Also raise up a great reflection, worth give up of college, family, friends and of live your always-life just for do what you like and be paid for it?Even if you're not a DotA player watch this, worth so much, I honestly don't play but is the second time that I see since was released last year and is amazing the way they retract and show what is e-sports, furthermore is just 1h29min.:D :)   An√°lise em portugu√™s :Melhor document√°rio sobre o que √© e-sports, apesar de o foco ser APENAS no DotA, j√° mostra o qu√£o incr√≠vel √© essa √°rea. Quem diria que um simples jogo pode se transformar em algo grande como um torneio mundial.Esse filme n√£o serve apenas para DotA mas para os jogos competitivos em geral. E tamb√©m levanta uma grande reflex√£o, ser√° que vale a pena deixar os estudos de lado, fam√≠lia, amigos e de viver a sua vida de sempre para fazer o que voc√™ gosta e ser pago por isso?Mesmo que voc√™ n√£o jogue DotA assista esse document√°rio, vale muito a pena, eu n√£o jogo mas √© a segunda vez que assisto desde quando lan√ßou ano passado e √© inacredit√°vel a maneira que eles retratam e o mostram o que s√£o e-sports, al√©m do mais √© apenas 1h29m.:D :)\",\n",

       " '  OH BOY I CANT BELIEVE IM DOING THIS  So i never thought i would put a negative review to one of my most favourite games i\\'ve ever had. it\\'s hit me so hardand painfully, but lets get it over and done with.I\\'ve had this game ever since it came out (I only got the game for the TF2 item you can get when you have pre-orded it). I didnt play it more often after 1-2 years afterwards i\\'ve goten it, and only recently have i\\'ve discovered the ranking system. I was so pumt about it, and started to play it as recent as March. that\\'s when I started to play competitive and realized how absaloutly ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• the community is. And dont get me started on the cooldown ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• they\\'ve implemented in.  So whats with the community?  I\\'ve seen many reviews about this game, and mostly it\\'s all about Russain\\'s and tk and Russain\\'s and more Russian\\'s and more Russian\\'s and it continues on. I\\'ve never had any problems with Russain gamers (most likley it\\'s due to me living in Australia) but they are right about teamkilling, team-stealing, the obsured amount of smurfs/trolls, and the mind ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• if \"hackers\" in the game. I cant get through one game without raging like a pyscho monkey on crack. There is a lot of cheaters in this game, but its just total ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t how the community wants to put this game in the grave.   Why dont you just report the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s?  trust me, it don\\'t work  What\\'s the \"competitive cooldaown\" and why do you hate it?    OMFG DON\\'T GET ME STARTED ON THIS ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•!  I\\'ve never thought that this good of a comapany would put the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•es thing into an already perfect game. And i know, i know why they\\'ve put it in\"it\\'s to keep the community clean and safe...\" -ValveNO IT DOES ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ING NOT!!! THAT\\'S WHAT THE VAC BAN IS FOR!!!!!!!i just how easy it is to get a cooldown  here are some examples (as well as the cooldown timer):  -leaving the game in the middle of a match -- 30mins-7days-being kicked -- 1hour-7days-crashes (same thing as leaving the game) -- 30mins-7days-idling -- 1hour-7days it\\'s total ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t right? especally with the kicks.  ITS A BLOODY  KICK  VALVE, NOT A BAN You have no idea how angry I am at this game, and it\\'s piece of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• company.i\\'m no longer writing this review, becuase I need to eat my McDonald\\'s',\n",

       " \" 6/10 TL;DR: Great visuals, very immersive soundtrack, unique detective concepts. No main-storyline, no ending. Puzzles were way too easy. Cases are predictable. This game honestly took a huge step back from The Testament in terms of storyline, but a huge leap forward in gameplay.Great visuals, Baker Street/Whitechapel has greatly improved over The Testament. Voice acting is well done (accents), but lip-syncing is pretty disappointing for next-gen gaming. Very unique game mechanics with new interesting concepts like Imagination and Sherlock Talent. The only downside to these is that the game tells you directly where your targets are, which just kills the fun. It'd be better if the Sherlock Talent just gave the game a filter or texture that makes it easier to see objects of interest, rather than make them glow.6 in-depth very intriguing, however, very predictable cases. It's a great improvement over The Testament, which was more like an interactive movie. This game allows you to not only make your own deductions, but make your own conclusions, choose your own guilty party and make your own moral choices as to how you will covict them. No main storyline (except for  The Merry Men terrorist group  ), which is HUGELY disappointing, especially in a Sherlock adaptation. I loved how The Testament was all one case and was full of plot twists and in depth dialogue and story. Overall, this game feels half-finished but  is definitely worth your time  if you are into the more thinking-based games that require your full attention/patience.\",\n",

Now has more Australian ping-friendly servers, uses up a lot less CPU.TL;DR: Great visuals, very individual, bit buggy, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• community, very unique, WORTH PLAYING!Been playing this game for a while now and I have high hopes for the full-version. The loading times and setup however is pretty ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•-poor. I've spent 16 hours in-game, most of which are probably spent joining servers and loading up the game. The graphics/animations were nice. Original textures and decal, detailed landscapes and maps. Animations are mostly consistent. It has a unique fighting engine, having an anatomical damage-system instead of the normal health based system, like the Overflow indie engine. The physics are a bit off, seeing a lot of bugs and glitches here and there but that's okay for a game still in it's beta stage. Controls were fairly simple, hard to pickup but very satisfying when I got the hand of it. The community at times can be painful to put up with, witnessed first hand on many accounts people taking over servers and changing the game-modes (Free-duels to FFA). Full of obnoxious kids ignoring game rules, leaves me exiting the game frustrated every time. I only bother with higher level servers, although I don't fit that criteria, is the only games that have players who give two ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• about the quality of gameplay. I'm sure there will be a more in depth story-line to come in the future, but for now it's not fair to hold the game against it.\",\n",

The swimfin acts like the scarf, and while the scarf in journey lets you fly, the swimfin in this game lets you swim faster for small period of time. You can collect shells to increase the size of your swimfin, so you can use it\\'s speed boost for more time.Something i notused is that even when i got hit by \"enemies\" (lets just call them enemies so i don\\'t spoil anything) my swimfin didn\\'t seem to get shorter, which kinda disappointed me.  ControlsThe controls are very nice, intuitive and responsive,  WITH EXCEPTION of the camera, which can be a hassle to control sometimes. (Keep in mind im using a Xbox One controller) GraphicsAs you\\'ve probably seen in the trailer, the graphics of this game are pretty. I personally don\\'t like the graphical style they chose (simpler textures), but that varies from person to person. GFX are VERY nice, reflections and lighting look amazing, but i\\'d say they\\'re not as good as they were in Journey, especially lighting. (Please keep in mind im playing in maxed settings in 4K) PerformanceThis game runs somewhat good, but it has its issues. Im using a GTX 1080 and Intel Core i7-4790K, and as stated before, im running Abz√ª on maxed settings in 4K. My highest framerate was 72fps, lowest was 24fps and average was 51fps. Im gonna go and say this game could have ran better if it wasn\\'t a console port, but what can we do, right? SoundThe sounds and noises creatures make are exceptional, and props to whoever recorded/edited/made them. Background noises are also very good, but they could have been done better. SoundtrackThe soundtrack, just like Journey\\'s soundtrack, is FREAKIN FANTASTIC, all the songs match the ambient and the situation you are in, giving the game an awesome cinematic feel. Im gonna have to say that (at least in my opinion) Journey\\'s soundtrack is better.  GameplayThe gameplay feels very fluid, activating objects doesn\\'t interrupt you (mostly), and there are no parts which abruptly get too slow or too fast, disrupting the experience. A thing i\\'d like to point out is that Abz√ª has nowhere near as much \"Wow\" moments like in Journey, whereas you are amazed at least once every level, and some animations feel weird, for example, StoryDon\\'t worry, im not going to spoil anything. Just like in Journey, the story is kind of vague, there\\'s not much context or objetive. Abz√ª is A LOT shorter than Journey, so much in fact, that i was kinda disappointed when it was over. FinalizationWell, by reading my review so far, you\\'d say i recommend Abz√ª. And i do. Kind of... If you came here for the same reason that i did, for an improvement over Journey, im sorry, but this isn\\'t it. Don\\'t get me wrong, Abz√ª is a great game by itself, but it wasn\\'t up to my expectations, especially because it was developed by the same developers that developed Journey.',\n",
       " \" After completeing all the levels with the main protagonist, here is my review. 8.5/10 The games random elements keep thing interesting, but I find myself cysling through the rng untill I find one that is a little easier. It does help the game stay fresh when you are repeating a level generally several times.The difficulty starts relatively high and only continues for the most part as the game progresses.If you find the first level frustratingly difficult and have played less than 2 hours, consider gettign a refund as it only gets harder.Level design is wonderful with enough variety that even though the game never changes its machanics it doesn't get boring. With the difficulty so high you genuinally feel a sense of achievement when a level is completed.The artstyle while simple is brilliant as is the sound design.

Although we only have Episode One as of this review, it's safe to say that Telltale has done an incredible job and I cannot wait to see more episodes and perhaps even future seasons.  Pros  Immersive as hell. The atmosphere, story, character development, everything was amazing.  Detective work. Incredible voice acting all around. Really digging Troy Baker as Bruce Wayne/Batman. It's a Telltale Batman game. That speaks for itself. Fight scenes in this are amazing. Camera angles, the intensity, everything about them make you feel like the Batman.  Choosing your plan of attack is awesome. Hope to see this feature used more in future episodes.  Cons   Performance issues. Won't dwell on this too much, has already been discussed to death. Not really a con but, first episode was a little slow paced. I personally didn't mind this but some may be a bit put off by the large amount of dialogue. Overalll Score: 8.5/10.Once future patches are released that deal with the current performance issues, I Strongly reccomend purchasing this. Personally, it is my favourite Telltale Game since the first season of The Walking Dead. Adding on from that, not everyone will face issues with running the game so I strongly suggest getting it to either give it a go or just wait until the patches roll on out. Strongly reccomend this game, get it whenever, you most likely won't regret it.\",\n",

THE GOOD STUFF The gameplay is exciting, I often find myself on my toes, always alert for the \"Monster has startled the birds icon\" I couldn\\'t wait to spring into action with my team mates. Playing as the monster is just as exciting, always on the prowl, sniffing out your enemies as you devour the wildlife and become so powerful, the hunters become the prey.The classes the game provides (Assault, trapper, medic and support). Everyone has their own job and if one falls, the hunters may find it difficult to survive. The class system makes it important for Teamwork to exist within the game, making it a very good game to play with friends.Even on low graphics (had to turn it down due to optimization issues, more on that later) the game looks great, enviroments are lush and the dark, gloomy time setting makes the games atnosphere that much better THE BAD STUFF I\\'ve read other reviews and forums and it seems that alot of people are having issues with the game, even with powerful systems, admitedly my system isnt \\'Top Tier\\' but it\\'s no scrap yard and I was having issues running the game on High, to get a smooth, enjoyable experience I had to turn the graphics down to Low. However I didn\\'t expect much less, it is in Alpha after all.The loading times took ALONG time, I mean 10-15 minutes long just to get into a bloody level! I kept having audio issues, gun sounds repeatedly going off when I wasn\\'t firing etc, quite irritating THE CONCLUSION It\\'s good, its very good....FOR AN ALPHA, you need to keep that in mind when playing something that isn\\'t a full release, the devs have already said they are continuing to add on to this game and have a very clean, polished game out in Febuary.I highly recomend this, unfortunately I am writing this on the last day, I will ofcourse try to get a couple more hours in, so lets hope the full game is as pleasant as this.',\n",

When you think you\\'ve gotten close to the end the game slaps you with another few missions and an entirely new antagonist. I couldn\\'t even bring myself to continue. The hacking is a gimmick that is rarely put to use in interesting ways, instead you often just find yourself robbing people with rich bank accounts so you can buy another outfit or the next gun and the driving, which you will spend a lot of time doing, is mediocre at best. It\\'s hard to care about the characters in this game when they come in two flavours, hackers and people you need to rescue from hackers.

For example, in one of the first few missions, I was running along when I run into this huge ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• scorpion thing that comes out of the ground and shoots a giant reflective ball at me. Naturally, I move out of the way of the ball and look to where it lands and realise that it just created terrain. I swear I spent about 15 minutes just screwing around with what was now my new best friend and making what was once a grassy plain into a deslote wasteland full of mountains. Its that sort of thing that makes me love this game. Not to mention, not long after that mission, you get a powerup that lets you shoot, get this: THE BALLS THE FREAKING SCORPIONS CAN SHOOT. That point is the happiest any game has ever made me feel. However this powerup is a little unbalanced, as it does ridiculous amounts of damage AND is AOE. Basically, this game is full of silliness like that and it is surprisingly fun. I would recommend it to anyone who just wants to screw around with a game.',\n",
       " \" Chairman's  BioShock Infinite  review Okay so it's hard to deny that the original  BioShock  was brilliant. An enticing duology that was highly praised for its originality and novelty. As a game on its own,  BioShock Infinite  was certainly an intriguing game, dealing with such themes as xenophobia, religion and racism. Those who don't have the expectations from the last BioShock games will certainly get a kick out of this game, but for me it just didn't live up to what I expect from a BioShock game and this has admittedly affected the way I view this game and has taken the pleasure out of my gameplay experience.Rating:  8.5/10 It's still a BioShock game.\",\n",

Overview\\t Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO or GO for short) is an online tactical and first-person shooter. The aim of the game depends on the game mode. Game modes consist of modes like Demolition and Hostage Rescue. Modes\\t In Demolition, the Terrorists (T for short) have to plant a bomb at one of two sites, Site A or Site B. The Counter-Terrorists (CT for short) have to stop the Terrorists by erradicating the enemy team. Each player starts off with a standard pistol and $800, which they can buy other weapons and gear with. As you progress through the game, winning or losing, you gain more cash to get bigger and better weapons. The first to win 16 rounds wins.In Hostage Rescue, the Terrorists most \"protect\" the hostages from the Counter-Terrorists while the Counter-Terrorists must take the hostages to the evac zone marked in green on the minimap. If either team erradicates the other, they win.In Casual, your rank is not affected by your wins/loses. Other modes, like surfing and \"Cas Team Deathmatch\" are in here.  Ranks\\t   Catagory ScoreStatement   Gameplay 9Gameplay is fun and quick, however, it can get really intense at times, making it more fun!

       " \" Cry of Fear...Cry of Fear is a detailed game with a excellent story that is being told. Simon's Story in a nutshell -~ Simon is a 19 year old male and an individual plagued with anxiety and depression. Before the events of Cry of Fear (as seen in the first cutscene of the game), Simon was the victim of a hit and run wherein he was pinned to a building by a car whilst trying to help an injured man late at night. While he surprisingly survived the incident, he was crippled from the waist down and confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life, subjecting him to further mental trauma which drove him into becoming reclusive and spiteful of his own life. Doctor Purnell was assigned as Simon's psychiatrist following the accident, and using Cognitive Therapy, Simon was instructed to write a book about his emotions and anxiety to get all the trauma out of his head. Simon and PurnellPurnell talking with Simon about his treatment.Simon authored the book as instructed and the events of Cry of Fear begin - the events unfolding being a metaphorical depiction of Simon's mind and his battle to purge his inner demons through writing, the actions taken during the game showing how well the therapy works.The Simon played as over the course of Cry of Fear is in fact a mental projection of Simon and what combats the trauma inside the real one's mind. The fate of both Simons depends on what ending is unlocked due to the actions made during the game.^ That may be a lot but that mostly is Simon's background.- This game also carries some good Co-op experience, meaning that the co-op is pretty fun and shares another story about how the Police is trying to find Simon to help him out and take him somewhere to get help while you go on a wild adventure meeting some creepy things. \",\n",

       " ' DayZ Standalone After roughly playing this game for 20 hours i have enjoyed it so far, Although my review is going to be washed down by all the negetives i just want get my review out there. DayZ Standalone has been in early access for about 3 years and some people just dont read the note displayed on the DayZ Standalone Steam Page WARNING: THIS GAME IS EARLY ACCESS ALPHA. PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE IT UNLESS YOU WANT TO ACTIVELY SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT OF THE GAME AND ARE PREPARED TO HANDLE WITH SERIOUS ISSUES AND POSSIBLE INTERRUPTIONS OF GAME. As a short answer I would say dont buy the game until its fully out or in beta unless you want to face countless glitches such as zombies running trough walls and triple hitting. In DayZ Zombies are the least of your worries, you can play as a legendery hero or a bandit. I have been held as hostage 3 times already. You can also play a role playing version of Dayz, I haven\\'t touched DayZRP but you can play it here http://www.dayzrp.com/ Pro\\'sRealistic unlike some other zombie-survival games.Really big map that takes alot of your time and does not keep you board.Balanced weapons.Thats really it i cant remember anything else :3 Con\\'s Really hard to meet new people as they might kill you or hold you hostage.Really hard to find ammunition because all millitary bases/police stations are lootedEverywhere is looted if you play on a server with heaps of people. Conclusion Anyone who says DayZ Standalone is dead, or that the developers have \"taken the money and ran\", or that the community is dead, quite frankly is full of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. The game is very much alive and so much better than it was when it started. Even though DayZ SA has been slow off the start compared to other survivalist games (H1Z1, Rust, ARK, Unturned, Miscreated, etc), I strongly believe it will come out on top as the best survivalist game when it is finished. No other survival game has this much attention to detail and realism as DayZ. No other survival game has the kind of studio resources and money that Bohemia has to put out a strong title. No other survival game has mastered the hardcore aspect of survival and struggle better than DayZ. Almost every other survival game was rushed out on a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Unreal engine in an effort to reap money off the survivalist scene and try to outbeat Bohemia to the punch on features and gameplay. Games like Rust and H1Z1 fail to hit the bullseye on what a survival game should be. DayZ Standalone does this right and does it good. I would definitely recommend this game now, as it\\'s about to surpass the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• outta all other games on the market. Go out there and start surviving! But be warned of the glitches. Thanks for reading!  I also might make a fps boost guide for DayZ! EDIT : I made a DayZ FPS Boost guide https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=675608086',\n",

       " \" Disciples Sacred Lands and Disciples II .. are some of the best turned based strategy games out there to date and they are .. old.. almost as old as Tactics Ogre, FF tactics, or Kingdom Under Fire. Not a lot of game companies can completly screw themselves out of a winning formula.. but they did it.. boy did they do it. If you ever played Koudelka another turned based game also made in 1999. You will see how they flip flopped the entirety of the battle machanic to something less desirable than the 2 original games from 99 and 02. I personally considered the static grittiness and archaic battle system far greater than most others.  And where's my flags? The genius of simplicity in the originals far outweighed the more advanced or presentable offerings than most current turn based games at that time. However the Hex design is done quite well. Even better than most Heroes games. What really irks me is the way the combatants hit eachother.. and theres no blood and guts.. like it was in the old game. When the enemies struck eachother..  it almost felt as if you were being struck or shot or blasted.. this just has a very poor way of illustrating a strike to an enemies body compared to the old game. A Town a TOWN my kingdom FOR A TOWN .. where is it? .. i could barely stomache 15 minutes before quitting on the second mission. I'll just hold it down and play through it.. but wheres my towns?.. I guess that's the price we pay for such stunning graphics.. oh well.. I really hope this game series.. GOES BACK .. to the original design that won them praises from even the most hardcore turned based strategies.. guess I'll just go play Xcom.. or Massive Chalice.. or maybe even reload that old campaign from Disciples 1 or 2.\",\n",
       " ' DotA 2 Review  Introduction DotA is a game developed by Valve Corporation and is the second installment for the Defence of the Ancient series.  It\\'s Avaliable for all current platforms and is playable on all of them although there is a few bugs and perfromance issues for Apple Computers. Development of DotA started in 2009, when the original developer IceFrog were hired by Valve. Overview DotA is  a MOBA (Multiplayer online battle arena) that relys heavliy on teamwork and communication.  Dota is played in matches with 2 teams with 5 players on each team, both teams have a base they need to defend in the corner of the map. The objective is to attack the enemy team and to destroy there Ancient before they destroy yours. During a match every player is able to control 1 out of 112 playable \"Hero\" character that all have different Skills, Abilities and Play Styles. During the match the player is able to collect gold by killing creeps or other heros and using the gold on buying items from a shop thats located in different areas of the map. History Dota was first developed by IceFrog as a mod for Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos. It was praised by the community for it\\'s gameplay and Production quality.  It was then brought back to life by Valve in a sequel as we know it by today called DotA 2. Since it was first released DotA was featured at several world tournaments. At one point it was the most popular and most discussed free, non supported game mod in the world.  Gameplay DotA 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game that is three dimensional graphical environment. There a 2 teams named Radient and Dire. Each team has 5 players and can each choose from a pool of 112 Heros. The player can level up there hero by killing creeps/neutrals or heros and then will recieve gold which they can spend on items in the shop. There hero levels up by gaining XP (Experience) which will make the hero become more powerfull. Whenever a hero gains a level the player may unlock/levelup a ability for there hero to use. Each hero is influenced by it\\'s primary attribute: Strength, Agility or Intelligence. Graphics Dota has had a update about 3-4 months ago that updated the engine to Source 2 which was the first Valve game to use the Source 2 engine. Before the source to update the graphics were very virbant and had good colour but not good depth and shadow to to surroundings and to the heros themselfs. Now since the Source 2 engine has came out the map and heros look amazing and everything has amazing detail to them. In the \"new\" Source 2 engine they have great setting options for low budget, not the greatest performance computers, to custom built computer\\'s that have the ability to max out every setting. The Video tab includes a simple slider to adjust all graphical options in one or to tick or uncheck boxes that are best suited for your computer. Conclusion In my opionion DotA is the best MOBA out at this moment and has captured the minds of thousands and is the top played steam game on the steam charts. I would reccomend to all to have a go and see what you think. Even after my 590 hours of DotA 2 i still havent got a hang of everything and there is still lots to learn and the communitiy are very willing to teach you. Although it has a steep learning curve once you get the hang of the game it can be truly satisfying playing with a team or by yourself with randoms and working as a team to kill the enemy\\'s ancient.

But if today is not your day, then you can simply place some dirt combined with some ladders (to  really  confuse them)  in their path and you've fixed the problem, they wont be able to pass. SImple as that.  An entire freaking army blocked by DIRT   kinda sad The local wildlife are all phycologically unstable, and thus have come to realise living is not an option. Most animals commit suicide through drowning in tiny puddles across the plains. If it rains you can find corpses of deceased animals littered around.The tech tree is a cool idea, but        I dont want to make a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• roof    IM A DWARF FOR THORIN'S SAKE  WHY DO WE NEED FANCY ROOFS TO MAKE WEAPON'S OF WAR. FLOWERS AND STUFF ARE FOR ELVES.This brings me to another problem, RAIN IS LIKE FLOODS. If you decide to burrow underground you will have a free aquarium. But honestly the game is not bad.  The art style is nice, I enjoy the content and the dwarves are all adorable :3. i really wish that the devs could improve on it though. By making the characters more custumizable. If one of my dwarves die, like the one stated above, I didn't feel much 'sadness', just another dwarf that was suicidal. i just wish that each dwarf is more unique to the others, and when he gains skill level he gets power ups or miscelleanious changes, so that he is different to the lot. I enjoy the game but it sometimes becomes boring due to the tech tree which is a forced manufacture of items you will never use and are expensive to make in order to reach the things you acually want, this concept is in its primary stages and has the potential of improving the game, but at it's current state, the tech tree is more like a forced line of actions, not a choice based decision.So please devs, improve the A.I., make each dwarf more unique and special to the player, and make a better tech tree.\",\n",

       " \" Great game, for its time I remember when BioShock first came out and me and my older brother were in awe at how amazing it looked as the plane crashes into the ocean and flames engulf your vision in that opening cut-scene, we thought that this was the best looking a video game would ever get.A lot of time has gone by since then, and we were wrong, However this game is still really good and has stood the test of time. This game has a great story that can be progressed even further with the use of the audio logs scattered around the landscape and the game play mechanics are still outstanding and unique to this day, the use of plasmids and lack of ammo makes for some very thought provoking moments.The roar of the Big Daddys coupled with the soft murmurs of dialog from the Little Sisters from another room evoke a feeling of fear as you remember the last encounter that left you with little to no ammo or eve. In this game you definitely feel like you are nothing and could just be destroyed by anything any second, and this is very rare for games to do these days and is a great thing to experience.BioShock excels at evoking feelings whether it be the sadness or regret of harvesting a little sister or the nice feeling you get when you rescue a little sister and she runs off after thanking you profusely. But this game is somewhat unforgiving to you if you are yet to decide which route you want to take. Spoiler-Free Tip If you want a good ending, do not harvest any little sisters. SAVE THEM ALL.I harvested two and I was considered evil by the games standards which is something that I found disappointing as I thought there might be a system that would tally a ratio of harvests to rescues but that is not the case.Just remember: SAVE THEM ALLThere are also a few game-breaking glitches where alt+tab'ing will sometimes mess with the resolution or make it crash, I also came across a bug where the game lost 3 hours or so of save-games so I was forced back, and the game also crashed on the final cut-scene forcing me to replay the last section.Definitely worth playing, even today, you might just want to change some controls but after that you're good to go.tl;dr: Great game, even for today's standards, a bit unforgiving, and a bit buggy.

Then send it spies to ruin their party and make other parties more strong, however good luck with that. :)If you wish to have a friend to play with, you\\'re able to do that, however be aware that the servers are not up anymore and you will be forced to host your own server through port-fowarding or using a program such as Hamachi, playing online is very interesting and is often more difficult due to the AI sometimes being very predictable.The game does suffer from bugs, game crashes and HUD bugs are very common and get worse the longer you play for one session. If the game does not even launch, it is often Steam or your system and a reinstall is very handy. Game crashes seem to get worse the longer you use a constant game copy, reinstalling this game every time crashes become common is a good idea and modding the game can also cause crashes, however I would reccomend the WW1 mod.I full-heartly reccomend this amazing game, with over 600 hours on Steam and much more off Steam, it helped me learn more in-depth about World War 2 and made me truly see the effects of the war. 9/10+Unique game with much replayability+ Extremly In-depth if you want it to be+ Able to attack a country through unique ways+ Great moding community with WW1 mods to game enhancing mods such as ICE-  Bugs, often forcing a reinstall after a unknown period of time- No official servers',\n",

The environment is VERY Doom 3-like, however I'd say the textures are much better looking. Everything else is exactly the samein terms of appearance.Gameplay-wise it is not as good. Walking is a bit floaty and you can't jump, as Space is the 'interact'button. Gunplay works really well however. While being slow to start off the game kicks you in thenuts with a big horde of zombies at the end of the first level. However while this pumps up the gamethe general gameplay is slow.Feature-wise it is very good. You can buy different items in the in-game shop with CREDITS YOU PICK UP IN-GAME. NO MICRO-TRANSACTIONS. THANK JESUS HIMSELF. Anyways, the guns in thestore seem to be varied and they look very nice. Problems: - Had minor issues with menus over-lapping while running on my 3 monitors - No jumping - Slow gameplayWould I recommend it? YEP. Remember my comment about Doom 4 having some competition? Yeah, I was being truthful. I honestly think if the devs fix the slow gameplay, walking and lack ofjumping, this could be a classic that will be remembered for years to come.Doom, watch the f**k out.NOTE: I know I go on about how this is the next Doom-killer but I really think it has the potential to be.\",\n",

It's extremely obvious in it's inspirations. The game incorporates a lot of ideas from Dark Souls, but implements them very poorly. In Dark Souls, dying to a boss is mostly due to lack of skill. In Salt and Sanctuary, however, I found many of the mechanics, and the enemy and boss AI to be poorly programmed. Rolling is unreliable, and blocking is clunky. There's very little indication of the stat requirements of the gear you'll find. Many of the attempts to create difficulty has resulted in things such as enemies and bosses that don't let you get up after being knocked down.

       " \" Recieiver Games rarely consider the details of ammunition. The amount of rounds a player carries shows up as a number in the interface, and reloading requires nothing more than tapping a button. Actually handling and managing the bullets that go into a gun is a complex task, however. Receiver, an first-person shooter (FPS) from Wolfire Games, wants to remind us of that fact. Unfortunately, it never makes it clear why we should care.Receiver drops the player into a randomly-generated set of rooftop rooms and tasks him with recovering 11 tapes of droning narration (without subtitles) and that explain the game's story. The player begins with an unpredictable loadout including one handgun in one of various states and some ammunition. The player may also start with a flashlight or, if his gun is semi-automatic, a spare magazine or two. He must then move through the multi-tiered linear world looking for the tapes, which can be frustrating since one can go through at least nine rooms in a row without encountering a single one. I myself haven't managed to get all 11 in a single playthrough before dying.The game only has two kinds of enemies: a stationary gun turret and a flying drone, both of which can kill the player with a single hit. Each has some associated visual cues, but most of the time the player will need to hear their alert chirps to know when he's been spotted and when it's safe to move. The distribution of enemies changes, and on rare occasions they can be avoided. Because enemies are difficult to evade and pickups can be hard to see, however, killing everything in a room is generally the only option.Receiver started as a response to a seven-day FPS challenge and definitely feels like it, from its spare graphics to its room-entry stutter. The hook for the game is that it presents the process of actually reloading the firearm in a significant level of detail. The HUD has no ammo count, and bullets do not magically fly from the corpses of your enemies into magazines the player can swap out every time he takes a breath. Rounds must be gathered manually and loaded into magazines by hand, with the gun safely tucked away. If there's no spare magazine, the player has to eject the empty, refill it, then shove it back home again. The only way to know the number of bullets remaining is to remember how many have been fired or check by eye.Receiver fails to establish that the complexity of gun handling matters. The detailed reloading scheme doesn't speak to the story, the aesthetic, or the other mechanics. Receiver doesn't treat aiming or shooting the weapon with the same carefulness it reserves for reloading, and doesn't fiddle much with the basics of movement, yet running and shooting are the core verbs of the game. By making the world randomly generated, the developers give up the opportunity to design encounters where efficient reloading matters. As a consequence, becoming more skilled with the game's most intricate systems doesn't make a player any more likely to succeed. Receiver's complex gun-handling mechanics are irrelevant in the context of its larger design.That's a shame, because the larger design has nothing to recommend it. The perfunctory story and low-poly world of Receiver aren't interesting to explore in their own right, much less when one must overcome the game's unforgiving difficulty. The choice to generate the world randomly might add replay value, but it also adds much to the frustration level while costing the game the ability to present rewarding encounters that highlight its unique mechanics. Receiver has a neat idea at its core, but that didn't translate into an interesting game.Final Score:  3.5   4 /10 \",\n",

       " \" Review  Pros   Unlike most logic puzzles Hexcells puzzles maintain actual difficulty levels and continually present challenges without ever involving guessing to arrive at a solved puzzle. Albeit in saying this I've found some Custom Puzzles so difficult I almost disregard logic and brute force a solution... Whilst the number of levels is limited to an extent (Each Chapter contains 6 Stages, ergo 36 levels/stages total). Hexcells has a Random Puzzle Generator function aswell as the ability to access Custom Puzzles of which are obtainable from  Hexcells Subreddit . Cons  Generated Level(s) complexity, from all the puzzles I've attempted to solve using this function/feature have all been relatively simple to solve. I believe the developer mentioned the complexity bottleneck is a consequence of the AI solver he uses to check whether a problem is solveable. However this is almost a non-issue as a result of the Custom Level Subreddit, there are some very difficult puzzles on there and there is such a large quantity of puzzles already in existence and that will be; you'll be more than occupied for hundreds of hours before you even contemplate using the Random Generate Function. Conclusion This along with the other two Hexcells games are well worth the pick-up @ their respective price points. Theoretically infinite playability as you'd be able to play Randomly Generated Levels and or Custom Levels obtained from the Subreddit as aforementioned. Rating: 8.5/10 \",\n",

Story (no spoilers) -The  story  was enjoyable but short and the character Delilah (who you talk to) is good fun to talk to and has a nice sense of humour including the character you play as. You are able to choose what you'd like to say or you don't even have to say anything, you can leave it and come off as rude. Talking about being rude, I managed to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• her off one time so it is possible although I don't know if it just happens as part of the story. Graphics and design  -The  graphics/art design  are stunning and the environment looks beautiful. The  animations  are nice and fluid as well. (Equipment and character animations) At times I'd get FPS drops especially with the last portion of the game. I was running it in 1080p, V-Sync, ultra settings on a GTX 680. I'm sure V-Sync was the issue there though. (Never tested the FPS)As someone who likes taking pictures of nature from time to time it really made it more enjoyable especially (due to the environment) with the camera you pick up later on in the game. You actually are able to keep those photos via sending it to your email; once you complete the game in the menu it'll say 'photos'. Tip for you guys! Sound design, music and voice acting -The  voice  acting is very good which made the experience great too! The  sound  quality is top notch too in my opinion. Personally I liked the choice of music too. In conclusion, I had a great time playing this even if it was short but I'm not sure about the price tag. I picked it up for $18USD due to the 10% off on launch at this current time but I think it should be $10-15 but I'm happy with what it's at. If it was $30 or more I'd say it wasn't worth it really.  So to wrap this up, I'll give this an 8/10. Would recommend. \",\n",

I fully understand people‚Äôs frustration with the Dev‚Äôs (Chucklefish) and how they shaped the game. The game has gone through many updates that remove core mechanics and add new mechanics, altogether the where slowing down their goal to finish the game by changing what they had already built and not focusing on what to do next with the players experience. ‚ÄúThey were just fixing stuff that did not need fixing‚ÄùAt the start of starbounds early access release I bought four copies for my mates so that we could all play on my local server. We had tones of fun exploiting bosses and endlessly reading throughout the wiki for answers. We finished the game when we hit the max rank tier. From there I played again, I started experimenting on how long the game was if you only cared about getting the highest tier armour set. But the game had exciting news ‚ÄúNightly build‚ÄùI knew that the nightly build would delete my character so I saved him. But when I entered the nightly/unstable build I saw what the Dev‚Äôs opinions were on their old stable build. They wanted to remake the tiers, they wanted to remake how you got through the game by adding quests, and overall they were controlling how you levelled through the game and scraping their old work which increased development time. - But they added a huge improvement to the rest of the game (weather, weapons etc).Starbound now has a better story and realism to what your character is doing but you don‚Äôt get the feeling of playing like you used in the old build. The game itself Starbound starts off with you choosing your character. After you have chosen you character and spent ten minutes customizing him/her to be perfect. You end up in your ship which is broken and ruined, you are then forced to go to the planet below and mine resources to fix your ship. You continue through the story crafting tiers of crafting tables to get the ‚Äúnext best thing‚Äù and completing quests. Throughout your adventure you will kill unique bosses and listen to startbounds Fantastic soundtrack! Conclusion I would suggest you to look at the games state (Current build and community) and think, is this game for me?-\\tDo I like adventure through space and finding better weapons and resources?-\\tDo I like following quests and helping NPCS be lazy-\\tDo I like pimping my house so I can show off to my friends.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Sz2zr3pZEoThis video is about the recent winter unstable update.',\n",

Somewhere in Westeros, Lord Eddard Stark commanded one person to go and check the middle of the battlefield, and two men to check Bombsite A and two men; including himself to check in Bombsite B. Alas, the men had a weird attraction to Bombsite A for some strange reason so they all stormed in Bombsite A rather than check the middle of the battlefield and Bombsite B. This left Lord Eddard Stark uneasy. But prideful and fearless as he was, he stormed to Bombsite B alone. (But crap happens. Just like every single episode in Game Of Thrones) Just like the sound of thunder, enemies approached Bombsite B with full force. Lord Eddard Stark fends for himself and asks for backup. But his cry for help was answered too late. He then lays on the ground and utters his last words, \"Why. Why didn\\'t you check Bombsite B? You all checked A. Why?\"As his men fight for their lives against their foes they were all destroyed by the enemies due to their superior abilities.Then the skies were shrouded with black clouds, thunder bellows and says, \"Terrorists Win\".The End.----------------- This game brings tons of memories, good and bad alike.  11/10 would solo B again.

       " \" THE GAME Ampu-Tea OVERIEW OF THE REVIEW Another 'simulator' game trying to riding the coat tails of Surgeon Simulator. This game is tea-dious, frustra-tea-ing, and lacks quali-tea. WHAT IT'S ABOUT Ampu-Tea is a Surgeon Simulator inspired game where you are an amputee fitted with a robotic arm and are tasked with making a cup of tea. In the style of SS, you control your robo-hand to attempt assembling different kinds of teas with the mouse and keyboard. The silly control style provides a challenge to this otherwise simple task and it will test your patience and eventually lead to some chaos. MY EXPERIENCE PLAYING THIS GAME Honestly, this game was a disappointment, and I wasn't even expecting anything from it. My experience playing this game was mostly frustration, thanks to the awful controls and mechanics.There is no grip to pick up anything, so I had to rely on pushing things across the table with the hand and trying to balance cup handles around the fingers. Speaking of the fingers, grabbing with them is incredibly slow and insensitive, along with the hand rotation. It took me half an hour of messing around just to make one cup of tea because of how fragile the mugs are, how easy it is to knock the shelf off the table, the painful journey of moving the cup from each station, and how easy it is to break the arm itself.There is little variety in what types of drinks you can make, and no story or real motivation to make them except for a sticky note. The game description mentions being the son of an Earl, but I found no connection to that in the game. The achievements are (despite the shocking controls) fairly easy to get, minus the one for opening the game 500 times which I did not have the patience for. There are trading cards, but I uninstalled the game before I had enough game time to collect them.The only highlight I managed to draw from this game was being able to flip the table in rage. That's about it. I wish I had more to say. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATION In short, Ampu-Tea relies on the 'joke game' factor and being a silly game for YouTubers to play. There are no outstanding features in this game besides being pointlessly difficult and having more 'Keep Calm's and 'EPIC FAIL's than is socially acceptable. It is not worth the $4.99 price tag, but if you really want to play it, wait for it to hit 90% off  on a sale at $0.49. I personally did not enjoy this game and I would not recommend it.\",\n",
       " ' TL:DR:   overall this is a fun MMO that you can sink your life and time into hence I did almost failing a semester of university. A game of fantasy, magic, an absolutely beautiful world  and guys playing as small girls.  Create your perfect hero or heroine and go off and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• as much ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• up as you can while helping children and the elderly to gather plants. You‚Äôll lose your free time  and any remaining dignity  but it‚Äôll be a fun time. This game is worth a play especially if like me you‚Äôre waiting for Black Desert to be fully released.  This‚Ä¶ Game‚Ä¶. Almost failed a semester of University because I got addicted to it during the week of study before final exams.  10/10 worth it.  This game is amazing amounts of fun and it‚Äôs free. It‚Äôs really solid for a free game and I like a lot of others must ended up buying something from the store. I have 4 characters and 3 of them at the level cap, I just got so addicted to playing this game.  Positives:    This game is free. Holy crap. I would encourage anyone to at least try it for that.  Despite constantly high ping the game played just fine for me.  Pretty much everything you can buy with real money can be bought with in game gold too so if you can afford to buy stuff in game you don‚Äôt have to spend any IRL money.  I was able to create a guild called Westside Weeaboos and that‚Äôs the best thing ever.  want to be a cute elf girl?  I know I sure do. Heh.  Then this is it, create and customise your perfect doppelganger That looks nothing like the real you lol nerd   People are reasonably helpful and nice at least of PvE servers I played on. Sometimes you get some salty people when you party for end game dungeons though.   Negatives:    No servers outside of Europe and North America. I believe there used to be an Oceania server at one point but not anymore. Despite that though the game generally played very well.  A lot of busy work so things like fetch quests and kill this type quests. Which is something most MMO‚Äôs suffer from.   I don‚Äôt know if I like this or not but skill specialisations exist where you can only specialise in one thing at a time meaning you need to rely on guilds, market or friends to craft items to use in your specialisation.  Some launcher issues with the game.  (TL;DR/ Conclusion at the top)',\n",
       " ' TL;DR:   Fun little builder where playing with friends/ online can be summed up with ‚ÄúYou hit my ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing space station you massive ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚Äù and gathering resources is often more of a battle than you‚Äôd expect. Often fun to build stupid structures or just mess around with other people you play with. Picked it up for just over 20 Australian rupees on sale and was totally worth it. This is a great build and gather type game, think of it like 3D Terraria in space. You can play in a sandbox where you can build structures to your hearts content or in a survival type mode where you must gather resources in order to build things. The game is pretty fun with other people and the community support means you can get blue prints and mods that can be added without messing around with a third party mod manager. There have been a few bugs along the way but the developers are pretty good with fixing those as they know about them (The game is early access, after all). The base maps are pretty solid too. I‚Äôve played mostly on the earth one and so far I have managed to get to mars, the moon and an alien planet as I believe these were all there was when I was playing. In short, if you can spare USD 25 (Or, if like me you‚Äôre Australian the USD-AUD is pretty crappy right now so that‚Äôs 35 dollarydoos) then this is a great little game solo and even more fun with others.',\n",

My Message To UberStep up and take responsibility, your fans aren\\'t here to wipe your asses with dollar bills. Instead Of This Piece Of Expensive Poop, Go Buy These Games On another note, I\\'d highly recommend Supreme Commander 1 & 2, Executive Assault and Earth 2160 instead of this thing, they\\'re cheaper and better made.

I've played this since 2011 (Gmod 12) but I don't play it as much anymore but I have to say, for someone my age back then, this game was such a blast and I couldn't stop playing it. I remember booting up singleplayer and then downloading stuff off the Toybox seeing what people have created and uploaded including myself uploading a save of a VW Golf and a Nissan 350z and reading comments; Anyway, then I'd download mods off https://garrysmods.org/ and I'd have to figure out how to install them as a 11-12 year old who was new to installing things haha. I'd even mention this game to friends at school and show my friends if they were over. Also I made an abundance of friends playing this game online. Many laughs and tears. :') I've met lots of great people through it. Looking back at my screenshots off my old computer is always giving me nostalgia of the fun I had.This game gave me lots of joy and I can't thank it enough. And it still does when I load it back up and give it a go nowadays. This game has improved in many ways. I really do recommend this game. It is great fun and you can do whatever you like with it! :) Thanks for reading!

       " ' This game is a joke. Warface is a try-hard, want to be Call of Duty with clunky, awful gameplay whilst trying (and failing) to implement tactical features and functions. Warface also has one of the worst Pay-2-Win systems I have ever experienced and actually makes me cringe to the core. There is an in-depth review below but the bottom line is; Don\\'t play it. In-Depth Review  Gameplay Like I said above, the gameplay is clunky and doesn\\'t \"flow\" well. I often find that sprinting makes my screen clanky and jagged and when I shoot my weapon it seems too.....rough? Pardon my low-effecient vocabulary. Tactical Play (with some community banter) One of the tactical features in Warface is to help one of your poor-tasted buddies onto a higher ledge and vice versa. I don\\'t think the Devs knew how sh*t their games community was going to be (hint: it\\'s very similiar to COD, maybe even worse) These features seem tacky and useless, used just to add some \"innovation\" to their game. Pay-2-Win Never in my life have I played a game where I have to RENT an ingame gun and not have the choice to keep it permanently, despite all those hard-earned game duckets I spent on it. Note: I haven\\'t played that much of the game and do NOT have a full understanding of the market system. EZ game EZ life I\\'m really bad at Call of Duty, like awful, so I assumed that I would be bad at this also, that was until I went on a 15 kill streak in my first game. I know the majority of FPS is all just \"point-n-shoot\" but come ON FAM, THIS IS TOO EASY! Theres next to no recoil control or bullet drop, you can kill some nerd across the map with a couple of well placed bullets from the standard, beginner assault rifle and the slide feature allows any skirken to slide inbetween my legs and topple me even if he has awful aim NO SOUTH-PACIFIC REGIONAL SERVERS WTF!?!?! Crytek seems to think the world is a weird, pacman sort of shape because they apparently don\\'t know New Zealand, Australia, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa etc exist because they didn\\'t create any f*cking dedicated servers for them, this is a personal issue but it should be resolved regardless of how bad the rest of the game is.

       " \" What is Counter Strike: Source? It is a multiplayer first-person shooter which is a remake of the original Counter Strike that focuses on the teams of Counter-Terrorists against Terrorists, this game includes plenty of maps including some well known maps such as de_dust2 with the gamemode of Bomb defusal and cs_office having the gamemode of Hostage rescue.This game involves quite a bit of skill unlike other first-person shooters out there which can be hard to get used to. How it Works This game takes quite a bit of skill as said previously, it requires knowledge and understanding of the game. This can mean learning the economics of the game, from nade usage to shooting and compnesating spray control. As you progress you will start to learn these things. Learning is what makes this game longer-lasting and more enjoyable than other first-person shooters. Popular Gamemodes  Bomb Defusal This is a gamemode with the main objective where the Counter-Terrorists try to prevent the Terrorists from planting at either Bomb sites A or B. There are 2 ways that will give you victory, as Counter-Terrorists you can eliminate the enemy team or defuse the bomb before it explodes. When playing as Terrorist you can win doing the same thing as the Counter-Terrorists which is eliminating the enemy team or planting the bomb and letting it explode. Hostage Rescue A gamemode which has hostages that are placed where the Terrorist spawn, same concept with the wiping out enemy team but instead of the Terrorists objective to plant the bomb, it is the Counter-Terrorist to rescue the hostages and take them back to where the Counter-Terrorists spawn. Custom Gamemodes Lastly in Counter Strike: Source you will be seeing a lot of custom maps and servers which make up majority of the servers nowadays. These gamemodes go from minigames to bhop and surf with plenty of other custom gamemodes to chose from. Custom gamemodes are especially fun to play when you are bored or just looking for something to play with your mates. Conclusion Well worth buying it if it goes on sale a little bit cheaper as it is a little old and not worth the $20 at the moment. Worth all the 200+ hours on this game however there aren't as much servers as they use to be because it is getting old and there are mods that are available which are a load of fun to play such as Jailbreak and Zombies. Hands down the best game for its time and maybe even today (at least for me). I do recommend this game to those who are thinking of purchasing it although you better purchase it soon as servers are getting wiped. Although if you are still wanting the Counter Strike Experience you can switch over to CS:GO (Counter Strike: Global Offensive). Its a good alternative but I still prefer Counter Strike: Source over it9.5/10\",\n",

       " ' Written for an assessment at  SAE Institute Brisbane! [sae.edu.au] I myself am an avid player of immersive space simulators, and Rodina is a simple, yet brilliant addition to my much beloved genre. Rodina is already full of great features, and has excellent potential in terms of the endless possibilities for the modding side of it. Even though Rodina consists of only one system, it has the potential to habitat so much inside of it.The flight and combat in the game is very enjoyable. The movement is all inertia based, and the weapons look and feel amazing. Shooting down enemies high and the atmosphere, and watching them fall out of view, knowing that you could fly all the way down there and find some wondrous mountain range where the ship crashes, makes the game feel extremely grand. Its story is basic at first, but I suspect it will later develop, which gives purpose to exploring and fighting the large amounts of enemies. The feeling of flying straight out of space and onto a planets surface, while dealing with the fear of burning up in the atmosphere build so much tension and requires focus, particularly on the higher difficulties. Once you are on the surface, and have fought off any enemies in the area, you can land and walk around your ship and the planet, you can even edit the layout of your ship. You can see some great sights exploring on the surface of planets, though, in its current state the surface of a planet/asteroid/planetoid gets a bit repetitive after a while. As with most immersive space games, watching the day start, go by, and end on an alien planet is something that gets most immersive space game fans worked up (and anyone who enjoys something beautiful), what makes it even better is knowing that you can go do it all again on another planet.This game is already a great experience, for a very low price, even if a short lived one. I am excited to see it as it progresses through development, and we get to see some more incredible sights from an alien system.',\n",

       " '\"5 STARS! A+! 4 MORE STARS!\" is wah i wish i could say for this game. now dont get me wrong, this game is phenomenal, but there are issues.firstly the good:-the graphics:for an indie game, this game looks awesome! the enemies are varied and unique (most of the time), the particle effects are spot on, and the backdrops are beatiful. i\\'d put them in a frame if i had a printer.-the music: it is again, very good. a very ambient, but somewhat blood-pumping sci-fi alien (almost metroid like) soundtrack. pretty much my favourite bits would be the guitar riffs in level 1 :)-the Gameplay:solid movement and hit detection. i never over estimate a jump. little to no glitches. and a fool proof way to stop people from farming the same mobs endlessly (that difficulty meter that fills as you spend more time in a stage. GENIUS.)and did i mention mulltiplayer. because that is important. this game is worlds bette rwith multiplayer as you and your frined muck about and get killed. alot.now the bad...-graphics arent everything and in a game where the very asthectic is a simple but appealing 32 bit pixel asthetic, its hard to complain. but in later levels of the game (or just later difficulties)i would continually lose myself in the swarm of mobs and lose a chunk of my health because i couldnt see my tiny-as-an-atom charecter amongst all of these behemoths who were similarly colured, and end up accidentally jumping off a platform.-the difficulty meter/timer is, as i said earlier: genius. but it fills a little too quickly. during the early hours of the game i found myself getting crushed by mobs as they were continually getting stronger at an alarming rate, while i  was struggling to pick them off. if i may present a solution to this problem: allow the player to pick how quickly they want the difficulty meter to filleasy mode might be 8 mins to get from very easy > easy, normal can be the standard time, and hard can be 2-3 minutes between difficulties.------so despite the minor flaws with the game (and me sounding a little pretentious during this review), this game is definiteley worth your time for those who have never tried a rogue-lite game before. the multiplaayer is a great way for you to learn with a friend, and once your done learning, you\\'ll see theres more depth, more challenge, than what you were already presented with (and you already had alot to begin with!)4/5 stars :)',\n",

       " '\"A guy once told me one time, \\'Don\\'t let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat coming around the corner\\'\", This is a quote from the famous heist film \"Heat\" to which PAYDAY: THE HEIST and PAYDAY 2 both used ideas from to create near flawless heisting games. PAYDAY 2 has elements of stealth, carefully intwined with elements of brutality to get the job done, one moment stealing paintings, the next setting up a thermite drill to break into a bank\\'s vault. i have had the game since release and finally decide to review it. If you are a fan of heist films (or even if you aren\\'t) i highy advise you to buy this game, also, give the less popular first game a spin too.10/10',\n",
       " '\"A man chooses; a slave obeys.\" Rapture is a vibrant fantasy world beyond your wildest dreams - it something to be remembered because it was so unique. The imaginative world is very dark, mature and dystopian. Grim tidings indeed. An astonishing philosophical journey - and an elaborate comment on free-will - accentuated with an incredibly enthralling and equally chilling 1950\\'s time capsule.The gameplay itself is the oriented towards survival horror but warped by intense action. This means that resource management is imperative and tactical play is emphasised.  I still consider BioShock to be Ken Levine\\'s magnum opus; BioShock is one of the most exquisite and compelling arguments for games as art. Overall, a poetically beautiful game that is a striking testament to the best gaming can offer. ',\n",
       " '\"Ah, Team Fortress 2, why are you so addicting?\" is what I say to myself all day - everyday. This excellent game is addicting and                           I                              mean addicting.I\\'ve spent over 2000 hours on this game and I have no idea how I feel about that... but enough of random blab.Let\\'s begin with... What is TF2? TF2 is a popular multi-player based hat simulator (ha ha, definitely an \"original\" joke), no story mode, no single player - unless you include practice mode and being on an empty server (which is unlikely depending on your location and the time you\\'re on) - the community consists of hat-crazed people, weapon-quality crazed people and Gibus [crazed] wearers.In other words, the community is crazy. Crazy but fun, that is.Don\\'t let the cartoony styled graphics drive you away from the game because they are actually quite nice and fit well with its 9 unique classes.So why should you get it, you ask? (Even if you didn\\'t)IT\\'S FREE TO PLAY! SO WHY NOT? Experience the game for yourself because you don\\'t have to pay a single cent and if you highly enjoy the game, then you have the option to buy it and become involved in the crazy community of hat trading.Therefore, sit yourself down, get the game and waste many hours of your life on it - like the majority of us because I am certain that you will enjoy those wasted hours. I sure did. I think. Maybe. I still don\\'t know how I feel. Anyhoo, I give a 5/5 for this fun-filled game. (Keep in mind that it can also be rage inducing).',\n",

Verdun is the first (to my knowledge) multiplayer FPS set in a realistic First World War setting, which is strangly something no one has attempted before.

Being a bit of a history junkie myself  I found this game hard to resist and it did not disapoint.GAMEPLAY Verdun\\'s gameplay is based (mainly) around team play, providing you and 3 other players with the ability to form one of the different squad types available to each side respectivly.',\n",
       " '\"Aw jeez... where\\'s all this violence coming from? Is it the video games? I bet it\\'s the video games.\"I\\'m just going to start off with overall ratings as I know some people don\\'t like lengthy reviewsMajor aspects:Gameplay: 9/10 Very good for this style which has become so rare (a third person cover and shoot)Story line: 10/10 The best I have ever encountered, far better than even games such as the Telltale\\'s ‚ÄúThe Walking Dead‚Äù Immersion/atmosphere: 10/10 The atmosphere was incredible, this game is one of the rare games that you can truly lose yourself in.Graphics: 10/10 Despite the game being a few years old I have never seen a game with better graphics.Minor aspects:Realism: 8.5/10 Aside from the lack of friendly fire and the fact that you face hordes of enemies while surviving (though your health is relatively low), this game is rather realisticSmoothness (gameplay): 9/10 This game felt very nice to play and its only fault would be occasionally I would not duck for cover unless I pressed the button several times. Voice acting: 10/10 All the voices suit the characters very well and there is not a single voice actor that taints the immersion of the game.Player involvement (choices): 10/10 The choices were incredible, however I would have preferred it if there were a few more. Overall:I don\\'t really base the score from the minor aspects so the score (from critic point of view) is:9.75/10Though, personally, I believe this is the greatest game I have ever played and would rate it:10/10General review:When I first decided to play this game I thought it was a typical trashy shooter. This was reinforced by the single player being referred to as the \"campaign\" and even more so when the game started off with a typical Gatling gun in a helicopter scene. However, a few minutes into the game I was proven wrong, this game has the greatest storyline I have ever seen, there aren\\'t really any incredibly ‚Äútear jerking‚Äù moments as there are with games such as the walking dead, however the game still does an incredible job to connect with the player emotionally as well conveying the emotions and journey of the protagonist. Without trying to give too much away, the game also includes a variation of choices that effect the game and also lead to multiple diverse endings.The game play mainly consists of finding cover, coming up from cover and shooting enemies. Though the gameplay is repetitive the various amounts of guns, enemies terrain variations and other things, make the game continuously enjoyable. The animation of combat is very nice as well, the darting for cover and switching to different cover was a very nice animation that made the game feel extremely nice to play.The atmosphere in this game, contrasted with the outstanding graphics, creates a unique world for the player to experience. The atmosphere in this game is unlike any other shooter and truly makes you feel like a real soldier, rather than just an emotionless killing machine, this is reinforced by the two soldiers under you command that are polar opposites, I won\\'t go into that though for it would spoil a large portion of the game. Overall I cannot recommend this game any more highly, it is easily the greatest game I have every played and the only real drawback would be the length. The game has everything that you could possibly ask and so much more. IT is incredibly unique and simply extraordinary, it is definitely worth buying and playing.',\n",

       " '\"Holmes: Awakened\" is a fairly strange story, because of its themes, and its characters.At least Becker\\'s in it...You know, Becker, that show with the passive aggressive doctor? Nevermind. You\\'ll understand when you\\'re older.The game starts with you trying to solve the disappearance of a man\\'s servant. From here, the game takes off, like when Mr. Arneson\\'s hand was carried off by a raccoon. Yup, it actually happened in-game.For a start, you get use what I like to call Holmes Vision; A standard feature carried in future Holmes games.Basically, you press Shift and the screen highlights all the interactable elements available in the overworld.No more scavenging for cloths, dirt and related objects! Just press the button and pick up the stuff.Thematically, the game has various elements that differentiate it from previous games. For example, at one stage, you need to investigate a mental asylum for crucial clues. You meet a variety of...\"interesting\" characters, who help you in odd ways to help you gain access around the asylum.Not only do the characters give off their own vibe of individuality, but the Cthulu themes sure make the game ever so cryptic. Especially at the end. And that man who -- let\\'s just say \"chewed more than he could swallow\".So, characters are certainly novel, especially the disciples of The One, with their dillusional dialogue and behaviours (one guy was a cannibal). Other characters, like Lucy\\'s employer, have certain quips and remarks that make them more memorable than others.Interface is also an improvement, as they\\'ve included \"teleportation\" feature as valid travelling (unless a cutscene is required somewhere), which works by selecting a place on the map, and travelling there instantly. Plus, all dialogue between Holmes and Watson is recorded down, so you can save at a crucial moment, exit and return playing while knowing what to do. Revolutional! I found this was a major issue back in \"Holmes & the Silver Earring\", as I\\'d spend about 10 minutes trying to find out what I was doing last play session.Also, they\\'ve included an in-game guide, so whenever you get stuck horribly, you got some help nearby.Very handy for some of the trickier puzzles. The good thing is that you can choose how much of the guide to look at, so if you want a small hint in the right direction, you can get a small peek at the solution process by clicking on the arrow a small number of times.Watson is also a spooky character, sometimes.Like, I\\'m walking around Arneson\\'s house, opening doors. And BOOM. Watson\\'s standing right there on the other side, looking straight at me. Scary sometimes, but you\\'ll get used to it. Hopefully.In summary, a great improvement means a greater rating of 8/10. \"Holmes: Nemesis\" actually references this game when Barnes is found struggling on the floor, and Watson explains that it might be the book they found in this game to be the cause.',\n",

More hilarious (and occasionally strikingly poignant) writing, a great new villain, some inventive new mechanics and the introduction of super powers make this a highly enjoyable experience.

The level of freedom is wonderful, and it\\'s striking how much they are missed when they are taken away.It\\'s not flawless. There are a few bugs - such as those which instantly completed an activity for me (not that I can really complain about getting Gold level for little work, but it was jarring) and a misson-breaking bug in the Christmas DLC - the quests are unashamedly grindy at times and the game world gets unbalanced quickly once Maurauders get introduced, making it particularly hard to complete some achievements.However, this is a game which is all about fun, and it well and truly delivers.',\n",

       " '\"If god did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him\" Judging by the fact that you are reading this, you have most likely glanced at the game of which this review is about. And you may have noticed the fact the title is partnered with the ostentatious declaration of \"game of the year edition\". One of my biggest problems with this game is that it does not deserve such a title. A more appropriate accolade would probably have to simply be \"Deus Ex: Game of century edition\".Yes, that\\'s right, I found a game that\\'s better than Half-life 2, deal with it 2012 me!This is the part where one usually describes what the game is and a bit about the gameplay, but Deus ex has an exception. But, as a rule of thumb, most people classify it under the simple and undeserving title of \"FPS\", a name unworthy of such a masterpiece. This is due to the seamless blend of RPG elements, Stealth and, of course, First person gameplay of the shooting variety (and no, Fallout 3 is not a \"better example\" because Bethesda never quite grasped what the words \"role-playing\" mean, and give out skill points in as plentiful quantities as the loading time in their games due to the excessive consolization that plagues this industry like the Grey death). Of course, the game is much more complex than this, as you are not necessarily limited to sneaking around urban dystopia and secret laboratories. One can simply go in guns blazing (but this usually results in immediate death) or, in contrast, can complete the entire game without killing a SINGLE person whatsoever. The amount of choice and the way it reacts to your decisions is frightenly high.But, nothing is perfect. The gunplay is fairly weak and the graphics and animations are fairly dodgy, due to it running of the already fairly dated unreal engine. The levels, whilst very expansive and well designed, are a bit boxy and bland, even within the context of a ruined 2052 cyberpunk setting. Its true strength, however, lies within its story. Without spoiling too much it revolves around the player, a \"nano-augmented\" agent (don\\'t worry, it is kind of explained in-game) called JC Denton, who works for UNATCO (United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition), a group formed by the united nations in response to increasing global tensions, including a terrorist strike on the statue of liberty (the game was made in 2000, so it was still perfectly fine to discuss terrorist attacks on New York). But as the player fights the various organizations, he starts to realise there is something very wrong with his overlords, and finds himself a player in a secret war for world dominance. The themes, factions and events in the game are likely from a conspiracy theorist\\'s nutty dream, but simply keeping up to date wiht the state of the world simply provides foreshadowing for the dystopia presented in this game! Whilst most of the exposition and dialogue is extremely well written, its delivery and voice acting is not as refined, simply watch any play through of Hong Kong or Paris to get the idea. But, I suppose there is some charm to hearing Asian triads debate about philosophy in silly accents!On the subject of sound, it is quite obvious that the music does an excellent job of making up for the questionable voice acting. When you first boot up a game and simply get chills from the title screen, you know you\\'ve got a gem in your hands! All the the levels have an apprpaite soundtrack that suits them, with seperate themes for ambient, combat, conversations and death. Ah Hong Kong, never again will I be able to go anywhere remotely Asian without feeling like stepping into Wan Chai market for the first time...My final word is that you should absolutely buy this game. It is very cheap ($1.74 in a sale!) and there is simply no excuse for not playing this. There is a well-known phrase that \"Every time you mention Deus Ex, someone will reinstall it\", but this is complete bullocks because no one in their right mind would ever uninstall it; it is the best 700mb on their hard drive! The point being, this is easily the best PC game, if not the best overall game, ever made. It is really quite sad how no game has ever been able to match it after 14 years in terms of complexity and competency.What a shame...',\n",

After 300 hours of play, I can think of literally one or two that offered me the option to avoid, charm, or otherwise think my way out of combat. (and that is being generous) -This game is Par, if steam has neutral ratings that\\'s what this would be-This is a console game, which happens to be on PC as well...-You will still like it if you get it on PC, but you will like it a lot more on console...-You want a good RPG buy The Witcher 3, you want a adventure FPS buy Just Cause 3...or this (think boarderlands lots of shooting...very little story and dialog, or character development)-Enjoy your cultural vandalism-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Quotes from the creators of Fallout 1, 2 & New Vagas, from an interview days before release...-Interplay founder Brian Fargo: ‚ÄúOne of the edicts from the original Fallout was that you could solve every problem either by brute force, by trying to charm them or by trying to sneak your way around,‚Äù he tells us. ‚ÄúSo, to take those three options and apply them to every possible scenario, I think that was a core tenet from a design perspective of what Fallout was supposed to be.‚Äù One example was that even the final encounter with The Master in Fallout could be talked out. =&=  ‚ÄúOne of the things that I like is that they do a really good job with taking ideas that would normally be mundane and giving them a lot of personality,‚Äù -Feargus Urquhart, Obsidian CEO: \"I think people play role-playing games for the story and characters\" =&=  ‚ÄúIt was always our intention ‚Äì and we do this in all of our games, but in Fallout we did it even more ‚Äì to have interesting characters that make sense and have interesting motivations, that people can relate to. And it seems that particularly in Fallout: New Vegas people really see people like Mr. House as these real entities and not just figments of our imagination.‚Äù-Co-founder of Obsidian & author of the Fallout Bible Chris Avellone:  ‚ÄúQuest and exploration freedom that, at the least, can be accomplished by a stealthy, combat, and ‚Äútalky‚Äù character. Often, many more options are presented.‚Äù---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Summary:it\\'s still worth the money and it is a good game for what it is: an adventure FPS. This review would be positive if they\\'d just remove Fallout from the title. As they won\\'t I will judge it as a Fallout game, in which case it is a disappointment.Fallout was all about meaningful character development, fun interactive conversations and varied interesting quests, this game has none of these.',\n",

They ceased development on the PC version and have since closed down the Australian servers, making it unplayable for anyone in the area (including myself).

Some missions are for the sneaky, some for the control freaks and yet more for the just plain blood thirsty. The missions are short yet engaging, the atmosphere fun rather than immersive, and the rewards simple: More money, more guns and more masks. Yes, masks are a thing. You would have thought they were just there to hide your face wouldn\\'t you? And you would be wrong.... but don\\'t think about it for now.Now it should be pointed out that you can solo this game, but the AI is pretty bad in loud missions and the game really rewards playing with friends especially on the higher difficulty levels. But probably the best thing about this game is the community and the development team for the game. There are constant updates and new heists, new weapons, new skills and even new faces. Some of these will cost you, and some are free, but in the end for the sheer amount of time I have spent in this game, and the fun I have had, this game and all its DLC have been superb value for money.\" - Gopher (YouTuber/LiveStreamer)Sums it up well :)',\n",

If you\\'re a fan of either of these titles, then this should definitely be on your list.Unlike Terraria or Minecraft however, it feels more like a game that has a plot and creates a desire to continue and develop that is otherwise absent in the previously mentioned titles. Minecraft (Vanilla) for instance, has it\\'s good points (it\\'s huge Modification base being a big plus), but it\\'s lack of tutorial and strong desire to complete the game lead many players into the deadly cycle of explore, build impenetrable fortress, get bored, explore...Starbound is not without flaw however. It\\'s still very much in development, so ignoring bugs and graphics issues, there is a huge level of potential for this title. With an engaging and well thought out game base, you are able to explore and progress smoothly. Simple old styled graphics, with coding for a more recent era of Sandbox styled games. For now, the bugs and glitches make it difficult to truly appreciate this game, but, once many coding has been sorted out and finalized ... Starbound looks to be a very impressive experience.PROS: Easy to learn. Huge degree of customization. Character creation. Fantastic soundtrack. Randomly generated landscapes and Mobs. Expansive environment (both is space and on-planet) Co-operative and PVP Multiplayer. Upgradeable Character CONS: Frame rate issues, highly buggy on some PC\\'s, and programming conflicts (Development). Certain areas are too easy, some are too hard (Balance).

(More in-depth review through the whole post)pros:+Story - great story, great ending.+Gameplay - even tho it gets sturdy, and there aren\\'t many combos you can do, it\\'s still when time comes a fun aspect of the game+graphics cons:-voiceacting - was pretty bad, mediocre at best if you want it-explosion effects-camera - sometimes, it can really annoy you how when you\\'re fighting a boss, it focuses and switches you from one place to the otherIt starts of really fast, and you kinda bump into a story. There\\'s no background, there\\'s nothing until you progress a bit through the game. Even then, you will ask yourself few questions, like, how did I get here where I am, what actually happend, but, even those \"loop-holes\" that exist in the story are minority, and should be ignored. The game picks it up once you go past the first chapter, the combat evolves, and you feel more connection to the characters. For me personaly, the way it was produced, I didn\\'t feel special bond between main character, nor the girl that was with you all the time. Story is something definitely memorable, and if nothing, you should check the game only for that. Gameplay and graphics are something that are also mediocre I would say. Levels are linear, so there\\'s nothing really to add up to it. Gameplay gets robust after a while, but what\\'s interesting in this game is that there isn\\'t that much of a combat as I thought it would be. There are few puzzles here and there, but that\\'s pretty much it. Graphics are also for a game that came out in 2013 I would say pretty solid. Nothing spectacular, effects when popping up the mechs aren\\'t fabulous, but that doesn\\'t stop this game to excell at what it\\'s best.',\n",

Let\\'s just say that I no longer find any enjoyment out of this. This is a game with tutorials that are about as easy to understand and Astro Physics, the difficulty curve makes it really hard for newcomers and really annoying for anyone else. In this game you build a town, get people to move in, manage the food, water, ect. Eventually you may even get a warrior to move in. The problem is keeping your people alive, with the management system not quite working, which is a big problem in a game that is all about managing. Here is an example...You set some of you villagers to start picking apples, drop them off, and then cook them into pies. You then get the rest of your crew to go mining, with the help of some warriors. After about 20 seconds the warriors decide to wander off, 2 of the 5 you had get themselves killed, on the way to the apple and pear trees your villagers manage to drown themselves, the rest come up from mining to find no food and then die from starvation on the way to pick apples.The result is a game that doesn\\'t want you to enjoy it too much.

       " '\"We have always appreciated the creative efforts of the PC modding community and we still fondly remember the awesome zombie invasion mod and original GTA map mod for GTAIV PC among many other classics. To be clear, the modding policy in our license has not changed and is the same as for GTAIV. Recent updates to GTAV PC had an unintended effect of making unplayable certain single player modifications. This was not intentional, no one has been banned for using single player modifications, and you should not worry about being banned or being relegated to the cheater pool just for using single player PC mods. Our primary focus is on protecting GTA Online against modifications that could give players an unfair advantage, disrupt gameplay, or cause griefing. It also bears mentioning that because game mods are by definition unauthorized, they may be broken by technical updates, cause instability, or affect your game in other unforeseen ways.\"It seems Rockstar didn\\'t intend for the latest update to disable Script Hook V, so modding can continue along as normal. Just make sure to not use any mods when playing online, because that\\'s just not fair to others who aren\\'t using mods. And to the whiny kids who keep crying about Rockstar banning them for mods, your \"mods\" are practically tampering the system, here is another articleThe most convincing/prevalent explanation I‚Äôve come across goes like this: due to the closed off nature of GTA V‚Äôs internal architecture, the so-called ‚Äúmods‚Äù that have made waves recently aren‚Äôt really mods in the traditional sense. They don‚Äôt add anything new. Rather, they tamper with pre-existing elements of the game‚Äîadd or subtract values, put whales where they‚Äôre not supposed to be, etc.‚ÄúTo give you an example of the dangers of allowing DLL Injected clients to connect to multiplayer servers or any other client for that matter, until recently, in Reign of Kings, hackers using the same method that scripthook uses, were using injected assembly code into DLLs to modify files on the computers of other players on the servers they connected to and in many cases, even the files on the servers themselves.‚Äù‚ÄúWhen we‚Äôre talking about DLL Injection, there is no such thing as singleplayer mod or multiplayer mod. It‚Äôs just foreign code being run, anywhere the user wants. The only way to prevent it is to check the integrity of the DLLs of any client on connection and cutting the connection as soon as a disprecency is found. It may seem like overkill, but the alternative is a complete loss of security for anyone using gta online.‚Äùfor short, the negative reviews are probably whiny kids who doesnt know whats going on and probably fell face first during birth, Rockstar have always been a great company supporting fans and players, if Rockstar didnt ban people the game would be swarming with cheaters. All these years Rockstar have been working hard to please their fans and this is how the gaming community repays them? Just because of one mistake? you kids have a rotten brain.P.S if you are one of those people who read the whole review, you should understand the current situation on why Rockstar are banning people is NOT because of the mods, its because the so called \"mods\" arent mods at all, it tampers the system in single player and multiplayer and may allow them to modify other players stats, we dont want that to happen right? Rockstar is simpy being extra cautious against players like these, so please do understand what Rockstar is doing.P.P.S if you got offended after being called a whiny kid, then you are a whiny kid.',\n",

       " '\\'Five Nights at Freddy\\'s is a fantastic strategy survival horror game that is probably the most scary and most intense game I have ever played. This game will make you sweat, shiver and scream.The idea of this game is you have been hired as a security guard at Freddy\\'s Pizza place. Your goal is to check all the security cameras, the lights, the doors, your environment, EVERYTHING to keep an eye on Freddy and the other the animatronic droids to make sure they don\\'t get to you. Otherwise they will see you as another droid without a Freddy costume and will try to stuff you inside of one (which will kill you). The objective of this game is to survive the night from 12:00AM to 6:00AM (each hour is around 1.5 minutes in length). You must survive all 5 nights to beat the game (The game saves at the start of each night). There is also an extra night and a custom night where you can choose the difficulty of each droid, on a scale of 1-20.The warning for this game is \"This game contains a lot of Flashing Lights, Loud Noises and Jumpscares\" If you really cannot cope with loud noises make sure to turn your game volume down to your satisfaction. The jumpscares in this game happen when the droids get to you. They jump right into your vision and perform a very loud robotic-like scream.This game I\\'d say has a horror scale of 8/10. I\\'ve always been a fan of Indie horror but this game is a masterpiece. It is scary and intense as F*CK!!! There is a free demo for this game online which only unlocks the first night. You can buy the full version for only $4:99 which is a pretty decent price for this kind of game. It\\'s worht the money.Overall this game is a very unique and fun idea for a horror game. I rate it 9/10, it is that good. If you are a fan of horror or Indie horror then I Highly recommend buying this game. Special thanks to IndieDB and the youtubers: Markiplier and Yamimash for introducing me to this game.',\n",

It has an outstanding online multiplayer, cool cartroony visuals and a greaty community! I suggest you go on the store and download this free to play, non catch game now!'I made this review aboout 11 months ago when I had only about 7 hours of experience, so I think I should update that now I'm almost at the 1000 milestone. This first-person-shooter looks like (from what I could tell) recieved quite a bit of hype with all the trailers and pictures uploaded onto the internet before release, which doesn't really change how the game will turn out but hype is generally a good thing. Before I got this game however, two years ago, my friend Qwertycoxy introduced it to me, and my thoughts were generally positive, but I really wasn't sure what I was doing exactly or the character's different attributes so I left thinking 'That was alright, but I would want more practice on it before I make a judgement' When I downloaded this game back in Feb 2013, I had little experience with the FPS genre so going into this was like trying something new while knowing the basics of it before hand. As months went on, I really got into things and I really started to enjoy the game as a whole. I began to learn the pricing systems which would later help me out quite a bit and my friend Ham introduced me to all these different fan-made game modes and even little minigames in those game-modes. Eventually I managed to unbox an Unusual which is without a doubt my highlight of the game so far. Anyway, the simpleness in the characters' abilities and the like really can be welcoming to new players and the like. I absolutely love the soundtrack to this game even though most tracks are only really featured in Valve-made Source Film Maker videos. I also adore the humour in item descriptions (official ones not so much the ones with a description tag used on) and the items themselves! These items really have their charm and I have to congratulate the community items that have made it into the game. I believe that this is a FANTASTIC game in every way possible (except the sparys but thats not just a TF2 problem) and I hope to still get hours of enjoyment out of it with all my friends!\",\n",

       " '(Anyone not interested in backstory, skip to next paragraph) Well... I have a lot to say about this game. Two years ago, as a person who was sick of all the physics builders where you build something extremely fragile and watch it crash into a wall and explode, I was looking for something new and different. One day, I turned Steam on, and in the daily feed that always pops up, I saw a new game had just been released on Steam called Robocraft. Immediately interested, I downloaded the game and found myself in literally exactly what I had been looking for ever since I first discovered Minecraft, a battle arena game where you build your contestants literally from scratch. The devs actively published new updates that improved the game, and for a good year, Robocraft was the best - and only - game I ever routinely played. A lot has changed since then.-The devs released this game with the intentions of keeping it as not only a free-to-play (F2P) game, but a free to win game as well, one where nothing that actually altered the gameplay would be locked behind paywalls. This is one of the issues I would like to talk about. The old system had you earning a certain amount of RP, the currency previously used, that you could spend on pretty much anything except for cosmetic parts, which didn\\'t affect gameplay at all. You earned a decent amount from playing, and each day, all of your bots in each garage (before, you started with 3 garages and had to pay for more) would have a 2x multiplier on your score from your first victory each day with each bot. This system allowed you to get what you wanted when you wanted it. Now, with the crate drop system, your hard earned winnings are completely randomized. One day you could get essentially nothing, the next you could get the rarest items in crate after crate. This system has more or less been fine with the endgame players and beginners, but the \"middle class\" of players - those who had been playing for a little while and were working their way up - got hit hard. You need a tank track to finally complete that bot, but don\\'t have enough Robits to forge one? Too bad, you got a hover blade or some cubes. That\\'s not even mentioning the horrible, and broken, economy (check the subreddit, one of my friends posted an explanation on how the system is broken).-The roboshop has also ruined the game. Once, if you wanted a great bot, you had to make it yourself or at least build it from the ground up with a guide, both of which taught you a lot on how to build a robot. But now, you can buy an overpowered bot from the shop without lifting a finger. This massively destroys the whole feel of the game, as you aren\\'t forced to learn how to make a bot better, cause if it isn\\'t, you can just dismantle it and buy a new one.-Finally, the devs aren\\'t listening to their community. They claim that the game is forged from the community\\'s feedback, but if it was, Epic Loot wouldn\\'t exist, or at least would be made with a much better economy. If you don\\'t get what you want from a crate, you can simply reforge it! ...or so was the idea. Let\\'s use a legendary as example. To buy a Mega SMG, it costs 125,000 Robits. To sell one, on the other hand, you would only get 31,250. Meaning it would take you 4 mega SMG\\'s, among the hardest items to randomly get in the game, to make 1. What kind of economy is that?!-TL;DR: Robocraft used to be good. The tiers more or less worked, at least better than it does now, we didn\\'t have or even want some of the items we do now, and the economy is not only bad, but also broken. The devs need to start listening to their community and bending the game to how the players want to play. My advice? Wait. Don\\'t get the game as it is now, and see if the devs finally change it to be fun as it used to be.',\n",

Hardly any lag or bugs so far, simply because I don\\'t play on public servers, so I can\\'t say anything about that. But going Han Solo gives you a great experience without aggressive players. The beginning is the most challenging part, because you start out naked somehwere on an island called \"PEI\", with nothing but a flashlight and maybe a candy bar and a juice box. Or, if you dislike getting killed by zombies, there\\'s the map \"Arena\" which has a slight Hunger Games feel.Pros:-It\\'s free-Little bugs or lag-Low(ish) learning curve-Variety of locations-Realistic-ish needs such as Thirst, Hunger, Sickness, and Stamina-Energy Drinks-Simple graphics-Skill cusomization-Did I mention it was free?Cons:-Heard of hackers on public servers-Heard of very aggressive players on public servers-Very easy after getting settled in with good items-Need to use the wiki for crafting-Only two, medium-sized mapsEnd Result:Get it, definitely! It\\'s free, so you won\\'t feel guilty about spending money if you dislike the game. Also, by the end of January there is a scheduled 3.0 update, that will hopefully fix most bugs and glitches, add a new \"Canada\" map, the largest map in the game, update the crafting, update the vehicles, and even add a new neccesity related to how cold you are. You can check the map update news yourself for some hype-inducing preview pictures!P.S.It\\'s free~REVIEW UPDATE~The 3.0 update came out, and Unturned\\'s new Beta mode looks great! Nelson is making great progress on upping the ante. Unturned is really beginning to shape into a full game, very akin to Day Z with the backpack system. The game mechanics are different from the Alpha, including a ton of different skills. There is fishing now, in case hunting wasn\\'t your thing, or you want to collect food without attracting too much attention but are too lazy to farm and settle. There is now a little bit of lore to how the apocalypse started, and the Canada map has been changed to PEI again. I have a feeling there will be exploration off of the island of PEI, but I haven\\'t exactly gotten that far yet. (Still free, btw.) The crafting system has been greatly improved, where depending on you crafting level in the skill tree, having an item will automatically show you what you can craft with it, along with the other items also required. Unturned Beta shows even more promise than the Alpha did. Oh, and watch out for Mega Zombies.

If you survive and stay in the game, then your next objective is to research, manufacture and equip your dwarves with the strongest set of the game (armor and Mithril sword), explore the deepest areas of the map, find and eliminate the boss of stage (there are 4 stages).As a negative point I must say that this game crashes sometimes, but u do not lose progress because it saves automatically every minute, what reminds me of another negative point, there is no Save / Load option, you can't save, try something risky and if it goes wrong, just load.It's one of my favorite games, I recommend if you want something to pass the time, it's fun and time-consuming.\",\n",

When you first start a game you choose your character. You only start of with a Ex-Milltary soldire and a Hunter. 2 CLASSES! when you start. The Game Looks Pathetic and it runs really bad only if you have a really bad PC). Combat is Sluggish when attacking zombies.Their is a leveling up System Thats Ok But not the best Compare to GTAV Or Battlefeild's Leveling up System. Loot is SO easy to find which is Ok.

       " \"(TL;DR at the bottom)The mechanics were bad but the gimmick and story were good.First, the crap parts:It's a Flash game:The game went into low-quality mode during boss battles.You think my computer needs it?The weapons:The beam cannon you use to travel can be pretty terrible at times. Actually, everything but the shotgun is. For every single weapon, excluding the shotgun, there was a time I was yelling at the game. Really, many of the puzzles aren't fair due to how the weapons work. It could easily be fixed by say, removing a set of spikes or telling us the slingshot isn't like the shotgun.The glitches: Bosses would freeze or you could fall off the map of another after a respawn.The death mechanics:Spikes: Respawn on the last horizontal surface you touched.Pits: Respawn on the last horizontal surface.Fire: Restart map.Fall off the map: Whatever it feels like. To make a good game, you have one mechanic. Not two. This game learned from Meat Boy that games with a high potential of death need to have a quick and easy respawn as the respawn wait time doesn't enrage players. This also rewards players for doing one difficult jump. Something like Meat Boy would make you do it all again. However, you get to the hard bosses and you find you've been spoon-fed. From the mole onwards, fire is introduced. Or at least map restarts. You find due to the terrible beam cannon that unless you jumped vertically, you were more likely to go straight into the fire. And with most of the late bosses, I had no idea what to do. The boss I hated most was the one of the candyland. It had two ramps leading down. Now that's all fine, but the stages never have invisible walls. Walk too far off the left or right and you fall to your death. For that level (which involved going up and down ramps at high speed), it was likely that using the beam cannon to get you up higher would roll you off the map, causing the map to restart. This enraged me as the battle went slowly to use the new mechanic it introduced.Other levels that were unforgiving, however, were always short. That's a plus for me.The good bits:The story is stupid. It had me laughing. The personality is great. The entire point of the game is great. It's fun. Basically, everything else I haven't whinged about. Well, either good or tolerable in perspective.TL;DRThe game is bugged.The game is unfair due to bugs and design.This game could be fixed with some changes to map design and death mechanics.The game handles like a flash game.The story is funny.The game is original.Both were enough for me to enjoy it.New mechanics were added and were enjoyable.Play the demo to see if you like it. http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/558562\",\n",
       " '(This is all based on my own OPINION)Dark Souls 3 is a Hard game, that breaks off then the easy RPG.It never tells you were to go, and it sure as hell doesn\\'t give you an easy time when you get to the place you need to be. When I first started playing, it took me around 3 Hours to actually defeat (STARTING BOSS SPOILERS AHEAD) Ludex Gundyr, and Vordt, then make it over to the next area, I think I made 3-4 different characters to defeat Ludex, because I needed those Firebombs to kill Ludex Gundyr, thankfully. My friend(s) started to help me through the game once I got near the First Lord of Cinder, I\\'ve completed the game over 7 times now, I\\'m always trying different builds and seeing if I enjoy it or not.Most of my play time now, instead of trying to complete the game again, is helping out other players, and PvPing. (And praising that I don\\'t get into a fight club) Some people you find are fun to play with. Constantly chucking down \"Hello\" Carvings, and doing Gestures, Whilst others don\\'t even Gesture before going into a Boss Fog, or slicing you to Death.A few times I\\'ve gotten a good laugh out of some people. I was once invaded someone, and they looked like a Phantom (Due to using a Ring) I waited a bit nearbye, and then walked over, he did a Gesture to look like he was Resting at the Bonfire, he Waved. I did \"My Thanks!\", I used the Bloodlust Katana to stab myself, and rest. Whilst doing that. I realised that the Bonfire wasn\\'t lit, so I wanted to be kind, and wait for the Host to come. He constantly pointed at the Unlit bonfire, and so did I. He brang out his Bloodlust Katana and started to stab himself to do Death. I clapped constantly, he kept going, and killed himself, a moment later. I see on my Screen \"Host of Embers Destroyed!\"(TL;DR/etc. Is)Pros-Semi-Long game-Different to other RPG\\'s-Tries very hard to keep secrets to other Areas-Hard game-Allows for all different kind of Playstyles.-Doesn\\'t matter what Class you select at the near-end game once you\\'ve found most things.-Community is (most of the time) fun/funny to play with.-The Community is happy to help each other out (most of the time)-Addicting if you like the game itself-etc.Cons-Some OP weapons-Some Bugs that can pretty much one Hit something that can be Reposited-(For some people) the game not telling them to go can lead to frustration-Starting players will try to kill everything in there path, leading to the annoyance of dying to things much more powerful then you-(For some people) It is easy to not do one thing right, and that will lead to your Death-etc.Thanks for reading my Review.

       " \"(Warning, this review contains spoilers of the game)Ok, this mod is brilliant. Whoever thought of this is genius. The game mechanics of Portal are changed, but nonetheless still have the same feel to it and, although confusing at first, you get used to them.The only things that really sucks about this game are three things.1. There's this part where you have to deactivate some machines and stuff, you have to go on an insane track of jumping and speeding and everything, except my instincts told me to go to this little square in the wall, but when it said to skip the section ahead, I didn't read it properly and jumped it to it, and the worst part is that it doesnt even skip it, it plays someone playing it which was REALLY lame. I was really disappointed and I didn't want to play through the whole chapter again for that one bit.2. Like Portal, almost no replay value.3. The ending of the game is just really bad. This new personality core called Nigel (who is likeable and funny) has been hinted as evil and wants to kill you towards the end of the game. But the ending is just a copy and paste of the original Portal. You're on a platform, descending into fire and, because your paint gun was deactivated, there was no way to avoid it. The game even points out the loophole of you not needing to die, and the last thing you hear is just Nigel describing the rising temperature and then the credits roll. This left a really bad taste in my mouth and it just felt the same but worse, because at least in Portal there's a lot more even after you think the inevitable. That really sucked and I didn't like the ending really. And there's not even really any end in sight of the game, it just sort of ends.But overall, this game is worth the money. It's got a community workshop, which is pretty cool granting lots of possibilites. If you're a fan of Portal 2 you'll like this game.Pros:-Great mechanics-Great gameplay-Good voice actingCons:-Ending isn't up to par with the rest of the game-No replay value really-No real easter eggs of sorts8/10\",\n",

       " \"(if you cant be bothered reading this then just scroll down for the rating and reasons on why it's good and bad)It's a really good game considering its price however it does take a week to get used to the controls and how some of the gamemodes work in it but they don't have a tutorial... It's annoying how you do need CS: Source to view a lot of maps and items that most servers use but you can get those textures for free off of websites which is legal (just in case you think it isn't) or you can do it through a tiny bit more legitament way by buying it with Garry's Mod or standalone but I highly recommend buying it in a bundle as it does lower the price by quite a bit. If you can't be bothered installing all the textures by downloading them online then buying it would be better for you as all you need to do is download CS: Source and just go back onto Garry's Mod but if your like me and your going to barely play CS: Source then just buy it on a sale or download the textures (to be honest I did both because I downloaded the textures but about a month later the game was about $2 so I bought it anyway).7/10 for...Negatives:- Making it incredibly dificult to download the textures.- Forcing you to have them in the first place- Making CS:source way too overpriced considering it's not even that good compared to CS: GO which is newer and cheaper- No tutorials- Overly complicated tools considering thier is no tutorialPositives:- Lowering the price to $1 on sales- Making the original price $10 (considering its a online only game)- In-built workshop compatibility- So many different gamemodes- Some gamemodes are mixed in with others on some servers to create the ultimate game (sort of like Sandbox where you can do what you want and build with PVP where you can still do what you want but no flying through walls, building bases, killing others and still building amazing contraptions).In summary Garry's Mod is a great casual game that you can play everyday if you want but it isnt hardcore so it's meant to be more of a entertaining, funny game which is a lot better to play with friends and if you don't have friends then use a mic while playing on servers as it will be just as much entertaining (you don't have to have a mic either you can also type in chat).\",\n",

       " '(sorry for the bad english)      As a gamer who played formerly played World Of Tanks,This game is one of those hidden gems in the world of gaming from your usuall fps games(Counter Strike,Team Fortress 2) i really like it but my rating to this game is its a good game but i want to gave a low rating cause the new 1.37 patch it messed a lot in the tier of playing and the progress just to get a good plane.Because of the new patch im late in the tier of the German aviaton all i have is 3 planes of tier 2 plane and 1 tier 3 plane i was outgunned,outpowerd,outtactic with it so the lost of my interest in German planes For the new who played this may not notice but over the years playing it they will notice how long the time to just to get good plane.       The graphics in this game are unbelieveable with its texture and detail of just the ground its amazing.But after all the need of the Golden Eagle(In-Game Currency)is pretty much very high,im using the British planes who made it to the tier 4 who is always struggling with In-Game Credits. im ending up bankcrupt ,this is what i fear in high tier gaming the need of a higher currency of something premium just play without any loss.      The In-Game matchmaking is one the worst that i would review,The new tier system making a lot of pro players in tier 3 and the new players who just made it to the tier 3 are very unbalanced.Considering myself using Russian tier 3 planes i see this often sometimes i get too good because of the new players that i dont like it because its not challenging enough and a whole of pro players that pretty much dominates every one but some of those pro players are positive hacker because i once  saw a low tier plane(A6MN) just ripped a wing of a well armored bomber(B-25 Mitchell) in seconds of firing it.So the match making system one of worst in War Thunder    Overall:this game is perfect for the players bored with the ordinary First Person Shooter game,a high graphic picture,its more a pay to win game   ',\n",

I did everything i could find out there to make this game go, then after this i went and started to look for a classic game....15 minutes later, nothing, so i started again, another 15 minutes and still no games. i changed my region to the US, and again the same thing! i tried the UK region....nothing! i ended up looking on steam spy, and even though ther are around 87,000 steam users who own the game, only about 100 - 200 people playing this game at any time. i tried for over 1 hour and using every server to try and find a match and nothing, i could not get one match in just over 1 hour! then i found there is a server browser, after looking in the make a game section of the match making...could have made it a bit easier to find there guys. then i tried all the regions again and looked for games to join, and i found 1 game in europe with 1 player.

       " \"*** For the love of god change the default settings. They are set to 30fps cap and vsync enabled. Garbage defaults***So I've been waiting for this game for a long time. When I heard it was released I quickly ran to buy it. The first maybe 2 hours of the game were great. Discovering how things work, getting my ship flying etc etc. After that the game just became a bit blank. It's just repetitive. The good: - Mass open world to explore- Not hard to navigate -Simple HUD design- Pretty amazing looking space to planet textures- Random occuring events (i.e attacked by aliens for cargo) - Interesting Alien encounters (Even if tedious. For example when you find space equipment on the ground you always find a alien) - Decent space combat (I've attacked a few fleets of ships and been wrecked by them appearing out of warp suddenly) - Fun little features like feeding animals- Definetly a decent game if you like exploring planets and such. - Enjoying the upgrade system as of now (Fueling is tedious though, but still really easy to do)The bad: - Buggy as ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• (as of right now you can't alt tab without crashing- You can't manually save- Random texture bugs- FPS occasionally kills itself- Crashes- Aliens really don't do anything - Planets do get repetitive - Mining the same minerals over and over is painful - Like others have said, knowing where you are in the whole universe would be nice. Atleast giving you a idea- Poor optimization for lower end pc's - No Black holes or abnomalies - Controls at times can feel clunky / irresponsive - Not really any tutorialOverall I do like this game and I'll continue to play it until it gets completely tedious. In 4.5 hours I've discoverd about 6 or so planets and actually flow down and discovered alien relics and stuff. I have absolutely no idea what they mean but hopefully that will play out. Hopefully better optimization will come (even though I haven't really had an issue with it) If you enjoy space games and laser cutting minerals and exploring many many many worlds while shooting space ships I would reccommend this game for you. If you're not into that but are slightly falling for the hype give it a miss. Until they add something or it goes on sale its not worth it unless you really are intrigued by the idea.\",\n",

If you\\'re looking for a casual game that includes a very well-made squad command system that\\'s not Star Wars: Republic Commando (Seriously, check it out, its amazing) and you don\\'t mind the Third Person perspective, then this game is for you.BE WARNED! This game is not an \"XCOM\" game, quite far from it. It\\'s a well made and fairly challenging prequel to EU. I\\'ve been playing on Normal, but from what I\\'ve gathered via others, Veteran mode is a fairly difficult challenge! Originally you will have some FPS issues if you\\'ve got a toaster like myself. Set a couple of the Graphics settings to medium or low and you\\'ll be hitting 60+fps in no time! Some of the early levels during this game are \"retrieve this\" or \"save him\" etc. But the mid to late stages of this game make it well worth it. The combat is relatively annoying at first, especially when you face the *******. Spoilers. Sorry. <3. For strategies/tactics I\\'ve mainly relied on the Scout/Commando classes, due to their abilities being useful no matter where they are on the map. PROS:- Nicely Paced game that doesn\\'t stray too far from what we know and love about XCOM- Agent Carter\\'s Hat is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing amazing. If it gets knocked off, you can even hit \"e\\' on it to pick it back up. Amazing.- Fits in well with the Enemy Unknown Timeline IN CERTAIN PLACES. I\\'ll come back to this later.- Nice Combat Mechanics and the Alien AI really knows what their doing- Set in the 60\\'s, how many alien games are set during the Cold War/Vietnam War Era??- Squads can be trained up to reach high levels and you can collect alien equipment to arm them!- The Hat.CONS:- Storyline for me so far can be a bit clunky- Some fragments of the storyline dont fit with Enemy Unknown- Total Campaign is estimated at probably 10hrs of gameplay for a casual gamer, but this comes to personal preferance- Squad Commands are a bit hard to get used to- Can\\'t keep Agent Carters hat on for the whole game :(Storyline Issues: ***SLIGHT SPOLER WARNING***While I do recognize that the XCOM Saga hasn\\'t been known for its whole Lore shizzle whizzle, some things don\\'t add up. During the events of XCOM Enemy Unknown, it is stated by Dr Vahlen that they have never seen these aliens before. Hang on a sec, this is set in the 60\\'s while EU was in 2015? I realise that Firaxis/2k may not have anticipated that this game would overide their original script for EU. During Enemy Unknown, we must also research Plasma and Laser technology however, I can bring home weaponry that includes both laser and plasma based weaponry to conduct research. Overall, this game started out fairly well with me, but after a while it came out brilliantly. The story revolving around the main character is a bit clunky and doesnt make sense with EU and EW, however I\\'d reccomend this game to the Casual/Competitive/Diehard XCOM Gamer who wants a 3rd Person Tactical Game that has the backing of a major developer such as 2k.Overall Rating: 7/10Thank you for reading this if you stayed this far! I\\'ve been considering starting a curator page/YT Channel so let me know what you think!P.S: Muton Elites will literally destroy you unless you spam the living ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• out of it.',\n",

Using the \"Chose your own adventure\" format, this game allows you to make decisions effecting your survival and directing where the story goes.  While Glenn and Herschel appear early in the game, all other characters and plot twists are original.If you are looking to fight zombie and shoot things, this is not for you.

       " \"**This is subject to change as updates come through**Forsaken Fortress Strategy; where do I start?It's still in EA, so I'll go easy on it, but for the kind of genre it's going into, I'm going to have to give it a thumbs down. Sorry Photon Arena, but that's how it is. Here's why:Pros:- Interesting survivor mechanics- Solid design and most things have a logical flow to them- Diverse enough game modes (unlike most other games of this type)Cons:- No tutorial game mode (or tooltips in-game). Sorry community guide writers (you guys are awesome), but a game like this should have one by default- Help section doesn't actually help much; the descriptions are quite bare; and there's missing content- Building functionality essentials are 'missing'; by that I mean, they aren't in the help section- Neutral NPCs appear as enemies on the map- Very repetitive events- I can hear the zombies, but I can't see them...in the day time**If you're one of 'those' people (and I can understand why)**- Made in Unity 3D <--- Not a con in my books (even though I am a UE person)I'm not asking for someone to hold my hand here, but there is a difference between hand-holding, and giving players a handy-dandy, well-written reference.\",\n",
       " \"**This review is based on the base game**A great grand strategy game from Paradox.  The first in their 4 strategy series, this game is set in the medieval period, streching from Ireland to India and Iceland to Mali.  The base game ranges from 1066 (norman invasion) - 1453 (fall of constantinople).  In CKII you try to continue dynasty - trying to make it the most prestigous in Europe!  The game is centered around your dynasty and succession.  If your heir is not of your dynasty, it's game over.You start as a count/earl, duke, king or emporer controlling one of the counties, duchies, kingdoms or empires on the map.  Without any DLCs, you can only be a christian ruler and not a merchant rebublic.  You cannot be a theology (pope/bishop).  The game also features baronies, cities and bishoprics but that cannot be your primary title.  As a ruler you manage vassals (rulers below you) and try to please - or overthrow - your leige (ruler above you).  The feudal ranking is as below (above = liege; below = vassal): - Emporer - King - Duke - Baron/Bishop/MayorYou can be a liege to someone below you, but not equal or above you.  Your vassals are only below you - not equal to you.A Catholic (usually) follows the pope, and the pope can orders crusades.  The crusades can be based on real historical crusades (such as many of the ones for Jerusalem) and crusades to rid infidels/heritics.  Any catholic ruler can join a crusade, and the winner of the crusade is defined by how much they contributed to the crusade.  Winning the crusade will sometimes grant the winner all titles (including baronies).Each character has traits.  Your traits affect peoples opinion of you and your diplomacy, martial, stewardship, intriuge and learning level.  Traits will be passed on by the guardian of a child and by events occuring to an adult (16+).  Few traits will be passed on through birth (such as genius) but there is only a small chance.One of the games biggest features is Casus Beli (CB).  A CB is a justificaiton for war - something you need to attack a ruler of your own faith. CBs can range from De Jure claims to Overthrow ruler.  A claim is just that - you or one of your courtiers is related to the ruler of the title you want.  Whether that relation is a blood relation, or through marriage it doesn't matter.  The independence or overthrow ruler CBs are against you liege, and are self explanetory.  Holy wars can be declared on heretics/infidels.  Another type of claim is the de jure claim.De jure is where is the title is traditionally in that duchy/kingdom/empire.  For example, the duchy of cornwall is de jure Wales, but is owned by England.  It takes 100 years for de jure to change, and it will only change if you have the whole duchy.CKII is an excellent strategy game - if you have the patience.  It can be quite frustrating at times, and will boggle your mind with all the confusing succession laws.  This game is a great mix of plotting, pleasing and prisoning, not to mention declaring all of that war.  With over $100 worth of DLC, there is a huge base for expansion and the game also has a big modding community.9/10\",\n",

I'll try to be as objective as I can, so you can decide for yourself whether or not it's worth it.If a classic top-down RPG is your goal, by all means, get this. It has all you need to get started - the default build even comes with a main AND pause menu!So, let's play pros and cons:Pros:- Simple to navigate UI- A LOT of pre made stuff to make prototyping quickly- Documentation for the programmers- Reasonable price (when I bought it)- People make stuff for this game in Workshop- Some cool stuff in the workshopCons:- It's easy to tell when someone has made a game with this program- Most of the community made graphics conform to the grid of RPG Maker - making most of the stuff look 'generic'- Want to make a turn-based strategy? Best you find something else.- learnerFirendly = preMadeCode ? No : Yes (programmers will understand this); - Documentation isn't as in-depth as some of the meatier engines out there- People make stuff for this game in Workshop- Pre-made events make it easier, but what if you wanted to make a game in a different engine?TL;DRGood for top-down RPGs, not so much for other games - but not impossible\",\n",

       " \"*NOTE: THIS IS AN OLD REVIEW. Tiers aren't a thing anymore, but for all effective purposes, the game still handles well in that regard*I totally reccommend this game to anyone and everyone.Generic statement aside, the concept of building and fighting your own personalised robots is not only an amazing idea, but Freejam executed it in a very nice way. You build with the base armor blocks a frame for your robot, and then deck it out with weapons, movement, electroplate (shields) and various other tech. The variety of different things you can build is endless, even now with the game still in development, and there exists a Tier system that sorts robots based on their 'rank' (higher level blocks add more rank) so that, as a newbie you're not getting thrashed by the elites running around with Tier 10 death machines.To me, the only downside is that Robocraft is a little pay-to-win. You can buy GC with real money, which you can use to buy parts at huge discounts, or to get premium, which boosts the amount of Tech Points and Robo Points you earn from battles. It's really, really enticing. Trust me, I have a bunch of Premium. However, this problem gets solved pretty nicely by the Tier system. All you do with premium is advance Tiers more quickly; the way the game is designed prevents premiums from being able to completely destroy non-premiums. So, aside from a little jealousy from the guys you leave behind in the lower Tiers, it really doesn't affect gameplay in any way.ADDITION - 29/10/2015So the first parts of my review are a year old now. Robocraft has seen a LOT of internal changes in that time. That sums up what Robocraft was and still is - an early access game. As a result, I've gone between playing and not playing over the course of the past year, as new changes turn me away from the game but I inevitably come back and learn to love them. Every new update, there are hordes of angry players - 'RIP Robocraft, wtf you doing Freejam I'm never playing this again'. And if you play too, you'll likely feel this way for a few days, but then after that it doesn't really matter. The game is still fun at its core and that's what matters.Overall, I give Robocraft a 9/10\",\n",

They are great, fun, and silly... though there\\'s a few drawbacks out there.Most of these Arena party games are platformers... and too many people have WAAAY different skill levels in platformers to make them fun or fair.This game is a lot more like starwhal \"new\" control scheme, a game where most people are unfamiliar with the controls, starting everyone off on a level playing field. What this game has going for it is a really strong sense of \"Honourable combat\", \"Casual rulemaking\" and \"Improvisation mid combat\"\"Looking at each other across the arena, blood has been spilled, but both your weapons are aflame... the rain starts... everything else seems to fade into the background, Slowly spinning up the hammer, charging forwards, both you and them start screaming...\"Moments like that seem to flow and occur naturally, Blows and weapon exchanges seem just right, your opponents rarely outskill you to the point of futility, and when amazing dagger throws do happen, there\\'s nothing but awe across the couch. It feels like one of the few local multiplayer games where battlecries feel appropriate and easy to do. The game is really good at encouraging \"epic memorable moments\", everything feels fair (even when it\\'s unfair).The game is also nice in offering casual rulemaking. You have an immediately apparent unspoken social contract for politeness, a weapon selection as required, not needing to go into a \"Mutators screen\" to disallow certain items... as most friends are amiable to not allow swords, or to only go for punches, or overhead attacks... it\\'s just really nice and refreshing not having to go back out to a menu to get that stuff done.It\\'s also really nice to see a bit of panic mode support, where your thrown weapon misses the target, and now you\\'re running away from a psycho with a flaming spear, grabbing and tossing everything in your path to try escape... until either you manage to pick up another dagger and fling it at him... hopefully with a little more luck this time... or you run into a wall and get skewered...Really, this is just an essential party game that doesn\\'t lose it\\'s lustre quickly, Get it if you\\'re sick of platformers as your only party game options for sure. Get it if you\\'re the type that can convince their friends to bring two controllers over.Remember that you hold X while picking up to dual wield!',\n",

       " \"*SLIGHTLY SPOILER-Y*As silly as it sounds, my experience playing Undertale was just that: an experience. Gameplay-wise, it's incredibly simple. Walk, talk, battle enemies. But it's how it utilizes those simple elements and creates a powerful story centered around it. As you walk from point A to point B, you can feel that you have made a journey. You're exploring this foreign, perilous world, you grow attached to the interesting and quirky characters you meet, and the way you face against your enemies is actively shaping the outcome of your adventure. This is a game were, like in real life, everything has powerful consequences that you can't just run away from (even if you try the age old habit of save scumming, something that Undertale LOVES to pull apart and analyze).A lot can be taken from Undertale, and very rarely does a game succeed in so many ways on leaving a mark on its player. Many of the game's concepts (the deconstruction of the rpg, the psychology of in-game characters and the godlike powers of a player to manipulate the game's world) can of course be preached by lesser artist's, but TobyFox has combined visuals, gameplay, story, music, and character and shaped them all into such a unique game that has proven it deserves all the recognition it gets.While I may not have the heart to play the game again, I absolutely want to see other players experience it for the first time like I did.

       " \"*Take this review with a grain of salt*Before I go through this review, please note that this game is not for everyone. Alright, let's begin.StoryThe story was somewhat predictable, yet still good. It revolves around the main protagonist (Neptune), who has lost her memory and slowly brings the main cast together who at first hate each other, but later on become friends. They then band together to fight an evil person thretening to destroy the world. Relatively cliche.One thing you'll pick up straightaway is the reference to other games and anime. Oh god the references. Also there's fanservice. GameplayThe gameplay, in my opinion was solid. You don't need to excessively grind, so long as you know what you're doing and not avoid every monster. Strategic placement of your characters is a necessity for victory in the later stages. Great thing is, exp is shared with your entire party. For example, if you gain 5000 exp from a battle, EVERYONE gets 5000 exp, unlike some games which only give the most based on who does what. This significantly speeds up the levelling process. There is also the remake system which I'll go into further detail after.Remake systemAlright, so basically when this game got remade from the original, they changed the storyline up a little and added this new feature called the REMAKE SYSTEM. Basicaly, what it allows you to do is add new dungeons, enemies for those dungeons, you can change the item pick ups, make new accessories and just create a load of stuff. Great addition to add variety to the game.New Game+One important feature of this game is NEW GAME+. Once you've finished the game, you can redo the game again and go for a second cycle. This is necessary to get all the added CPU candidates which you can create via the remake system. The good thing is, all your credits, experience, levels and items get rolled over, so you cna go for the achievements that you may have missed in the first run. The bad thing is that enemies dont get stronger at all, so if you're a high enough level, you have no challenge at all (aside from the colosseum).DLCPlease note that DLC is not necessary to get all achievements, so its not a forced buy.The DLC allows you to unlock 3 new characters:-Histiore-Peachy-PlutiaAnd the additional packs give you 300 levels per pack and added dungeons and colosseum battles, so you can go back and have more fun.All in all, you get 3 characters, 900 additional levels and new dungeons if you decide to purchase every DLC.So to sum upIf you're an anime fan, like loli protagonists and have some money to throw at a screen, this is the game for you. As far as I'm concerned, it's worth the money and time that I invested in it and I don't regret one bit of it.Pros:+Remake system+No endless grinding+Lots of characters+Good variety+Good gameplay+Fanservice+Nice variety of personalities+Good parodies+Great soundtrackCons:-Story lacks twists and can be cliche at times-Character voices can sometimes be irritating to listen to-Hard boss fights if you dont grind levels at early stages-Difficulty curve on some parts are too extreme9.5/10Once again, it is not for everyone, but I highly recommend this game. Also, this is much better than the original so don't bother trying the original and go straight for the remake.\",\n",
       " '*This Game Is Extremley Good!*I mean for being free this game takes it to the next level, the one thing i complain about is when people say things like \"MINECRAFT + TERRARIA = OUR GAME!\" Stop having to leech of the name Minecraft to attract 8 year olds, the game is good enough to pull in players anyways. Also this game is N o t h i n g like minecraft so a waste of advertising. I really enjoy this game except i cannot get to tier 3 even though I purchased all tier 2 upgrades and have like 10 T3 Guns.

       " \"*This is more of a first impressions review, I have not gotten very far and may or may not edit this review later*Saying Pixal Piracy is Terraria but with pirates is nowhere near giving this enough credit. This game clearly has complexity far beyond Terraria.No, a better way to describe it is... an adventure micro-manage-it-up. With the many abilities, crew, weapons and ship parts, this has potential stuck up the wah-freakin'-zoo not to mention that daunting hunger system, that some players may find a tad too hard, and the cleaning and repairing and the fishing and the...Ok, I'll stop.Basically, this is a complex game, from what I've seen so far. If you aren't ready to micro-manage the hell out of stuff, you may find yourself being confused and getting yourself into an infinite loop of starving to death. (Like me)Overall, Pixal Piracy has a lot of potential and if you're fine with buying games that are still in development, and are all good with micro-managing, I highly recommend this as it is a super fun game.\",\n",

       " \"+: Combines aspects from other games in a way that makes the game truly unique in its own way.+: One of the only if any MMO's that allows you to dig on the terrarian itself (although you can't build on the terrain unless it's in your own 'cornerstone' which is basically your own portable headquarters that you craft things at).+: For an MMO this game took an interesting style of graphics that I haven't seen done before (in an MMO).+: A bunch of classes to chose from, all seeming quite different from one another.+: The game is free.+: Can be a good MMO for someone who's never played one.+: You can 'deassemble' a weapon or accessory you don't want to turn it into crafting materials that you may find more useful.(Stating this) Many reviews on here say that the problem with the game is that it takes so long to connect to servers but this has been fixed (to my understanding).-: Although there is a huge arsenal of weapons (that you are pre-assigned based on your class e.g. Shadow Archers will ONLY receive bows) none of them actually change the way you fight or for that matter give you any feeling of variety.-: You progress so quickly that an item you picked up that you may have considered to be really good at the time can quickly become outdated in terms of stats. The game tries to make you feel good with this system of constant rewards and progression although it fails because you don't actually feel accomplished.-: No storyline, NONE.-: This game is repetitive, most of your objectives in this game are basically 'kill this and receive this' or... 'mine this and receive this'.  Due to there being no storyline you find yourself asking 'why am I even doing this?!'.-: No actual quests, you have a pre-determined set of quests that every player in the entire game is also doing. You have no freedom to do what you want (that is if you want to actually make progress within the game), you MUST complete the assigned quest to move onto the next one.-: The  entire game  is randomly generated making there feel like there's nothing to actually explore, it's just randomly generated terrain and dungeons (that also seem to be very repetitive). -: You must make an account for the game itself, this isn't so bad on its own however it can be very frustrating trying to get your verification code from your email to work (both me and my friend had the problem).-: Character customization itself is bad, (not the hats, there's plenty of those). there aren't many color options, as far as physical traits just about all you can do is change your skin color (e.g. you cannot change your height, width, etc.).-: Things in the tutorial seem to be out of order, for example around my first hour of gameplay I was being being told the buttons used to attack even though I had already killed loads of enemies.-: Does not have very much music.-: All drops are marked as uncommon/rare+ when it comes to the rarity tag of an item, I've never seen a single item marked as 'common'. I feel the game does this to make you feel more accomplished.This game has/had a lot of potential, it really did. Sadly I have to say that I must give this game a 4/10 for the reasons listed above.\",\n",

I know a lot of work has gone into this game, and a lot more hours will be spent making it the greatest it can be.Pro\\'s- Closest thing to Harvest Moon itself.- Love the details/graphics- Calming Tunes ( May get annoying after awhile )- Easy to waste a year of your life away- Early Access, ( room for improvement )- Somewhat playable- Playable via Steam- Fast and easy start up- many, many more, and I\\'m sure i\\'ll have more to add when I\\'ve played more hours.Cons; Annoying Features/bugs/Glitches I noticed.

       " \"- RECENT REVIEW -New engine, completely rebuilt, lots of updates, It's a pretty decent game again, although, having a beast computer is the only way to see the new engine at its best, It's too overwhelming on my computer, and i'm having trouble playing it with all my settings either off or extremely low.Its got lots of new additions, such as a completely new map, which is absolutely massive, and if you die without a sleeping bag placed, chances are you aren't going to find your spot again anytime soon if ever, horses, they're quite cool, and the deer, the animals are just completely awesome, except for the wolves, they could be downgraded, they run way too fast and glitch all over the place.all different types of building, wood, stone, sheet metal, reinforced, locks, cupboards, There's so many new features and additions, it's all had a makeover and is pretty.. hahaI guess it's a decent game again, depending on the server you play on, I won't be playing it as much as i used to, but it's a nice treat every now and then :)- EARLY ACCESS REVIEW -I stopped playing a fair bit after zombies were removed and replaced with mutant bears and wolves, It just wasn't as much fun, I enjoyed finding an amazing server with a decent community, running around the map on resource runs and seeing who could headshot a zombie first, Zombies really were the highlight of this game for me, after that was removed, everything went bad, there were no decent servers, there were hackers, less updates, found myself and a friend just throwing flares down a hill and watching it roll, for about 3 hours, and that was all we did. Thus, Rust had nothing more to offer for me and I completely stopped playing it.- EARLY EARLY ACCESS REVIEW -Rust well.. It's different.It may be in Alpha but it's already such a great game, I'm excited and dreading new updates, I love the way it is at the moment, not knowing if the upcoming developments will ruin what i think or make it even better, going to have to wait and find out, I spend most of my time playing this game, Surely enough playing on a populated server isn't a good idea, it'll ruin your experience all together, the key is to find a decent server with only about 20-40 people online, i'd say start off with a pve until you get the hang of things. Also playing on Official servers aren't exactly the best idea.Wolves and bears have a fair amount of health compared to the zombies, bears and wolves you have to avoid until you have a bow or a gun, zombies you can take on with a pickaxe etc. This is a great game and definitely worth the money, considering it's in Alpha, it's damn well good.I thought it'd be one of those games that look great but turn out pretty bad, Looks great, is great.The only downer for me is the fact it over heats my laptop, and that's when I play with Render Quality 0, and run it on the fastest option. The graphics are great.. but I can't really play with them. I have a decent gaming laptop.. but still It overheats so I have to take breaks and I don't like that.All in all, Great game, definitely worth a look at :)I'm sure more people would buy it if there was a demo, then again it's in alpha and only $20, Still worth a look :)I surely don't regret this game and I won't anytime soon =D\",\n",

I started back in roughly 2012, played if for a year then stopped.I recently got back into the game and i'm loving it.Now for the review:ROTMG is an awesome game. A simple concept turned hardcore. The things thats different about ROTMG is that when you die you die for good (and you lose all your items).  This concept makes the game challenging and makes you try hard not to die. The loot system is also really good so you feel rewarded when you almost die getting an awesome new item.Even though you only get 1 character slot by default, the game is free and it is worth paying $20 to get the begginers pack.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\",\n",

       " '-=SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW=-If you have got patience, a passion for physics games and a great computer, then you should be able to enjoy this game.Octodad: Dadliest Catch wasn\\'t one of the usual games I play. At the start we open with controlling Octodad, as you will throughout the game. This was one of the easiest sections in the game. Finding bowties, opening doors, and throwing objects at glass panes. It was a great way to do a tutorial, but as you walked down the carpet towards your bride, it became difficult. \"Don\\'t let people notice you\\'re an Octopus.\" And by doing so, you had to avoid breaking things. And after each level there was the small chase with Octodad and The Chef. While running you\\'d have to continuously switch between leg and arm control as you moved objects out of your path. After mastering the switch the game starts to flow easier.Later on the game became progressively harder with it\\'s challenges, such as the obstacle course in the aquarium. Moving across unstable platforms with lag was quite a tricky challenge, so I had to experience the game with my graphics set low. Also some people might notice the game glitching now and then. Items would mysteriously tear apart when you tried to grab them, or they\\'d get stuck in walls. It\\'s a good little game, sad to see it finish so soon. The script was funny. I purposely took long periods of time to hear what some of the people had to say. . \"This is scarier than an ocean full of spiders. . And Tommy!\" \"Dad, if you left me here, fish would adopt me!\" I also really enjoyed the story line, which it\\'s always good to have a nice story line for your game. So when you look past the glitches, the challenges and the odd physics with the default settings, It\\'s actually a rather good game. Just I recommend the game for people who have good patience.',\n",

It's a definite win for avid zombie fans and is a reminiscence for the good old times. Dead Island has an array of features not only the brain dead zombies per se but also weapon crafting, somewhat open-world experience and at times, mowing down horde of zombies with a rusty car. It's a great game indeed and deserve the accolade as TMoZG. [As if that acronym exist] On the other hand, unlike the console platform, the PC platform does have it's flaws. In hindsight, the game does stutters due to poor optimization even with a GTX 760. But then again, that's about it. Oh, totally not for the weak-hearted. Compared to Dead Island Riptide, this stands out. Nothing beats the original that's for sure.

       " \"-Final ReviewHektor is a very disappointing experience for the USD$14.99 that it currently charges. It has a nonsensical story that is neither as sophisticated as it thinks it is, nor as interesting as it tries to be.  Its music and art assets are frequently recycled throughout the entire game. It currently has barely 2 hours of game content, which is encased in a platform that seeks to draw out the experience over 3-4 hours through the use of confusing level design.Then there's the glitches, like being unable to interact with in-game items that are necessary for you to proceed further, causing you to have to reload your game. The worst part, and perhaps the most insulting thing about Hektor, is that it isn't scary at all. Outlast was scary, Alien Isolation was a stressful and harrowing experience. Hektor? Hektor is a complete disgrace to the horror genre of games. Watch any of the lets-plays that are currently on Youtube. Not a single one of them is enthralling, immersive, or in the least bit frightening. Many claim that the game's atmosphere is intensely creepy, and that they would prefer a game like Hektor to one filled with jump scares. Sure, jump scares alone do not make a horror game. Neither do games that are all about the long drawn out creepy atmospheres that eventually amount to nothing. You can only play so much of Hektor before you feel cheated and violated, like the boy who is strung along by a candy man with all the promises of a sweet future, only to end up in the back of a windowless van. No, there is nothing causing that sound that appears to be made by the wheels of hospital beds rolling across the corridor. Its just one of the many sound assets that the game randomly plays every now and then to build up 'atmosphere'. In fact, I haven't seen a single hospital bed move in this game. How about those creaks and groans and that squeaky violin sound you hear as the background music reaches its crescendo? Yup, just more of the same. Sounds with no force of a credible threat behind them. And do you know why there is no hiding in this game? Because there is no need to - the game is a bloody walking simulator. The only threats in Hektor reside in the creatures that you will encounter in this game, and what a disappointment they are.The developers advertise this game as having a horrific monster that tirelessly pursues you. Yes there is only one monster in the game capable of killing you. But the only times you experience being chased by this presence is halfway through the game when you first come across it, and towards the end when the game artificially ramps up its difficulty level by putting the creature in your path. Beyond those two occasions, you almost never encounter the creature, much less get 'pursued' by it. Additionally, it is difficult to be afraid of a monster that has pathing issues. There was one occasion when the monster ran continuously into a box that was in front of me as it tried to get at me. Besides this monster, the game scatters, with no logical rhyme or reason, half naked deathly pale people around the map. These death-camp prisoner of war lookalikes cannot hurt you physically, but are capable of reducing your character's sanity level if you are near them when they scream. The first time you encounter one of these people is a decently shocking experience, but towards the later part of the game, their presence is at best an irritating encounter as the game uses the same audio asset for their screams, and at worst you might end up laughing in their face, especially when you see their ridiculous transition from person into a reddish spectre. Who are these people-like things? What is that monster that chases you? What is the Hektor program? Who are you? Why are you at the facility? How did you come to develop your psychosis? Why do you guzzle antipsychotic medications like M&Ms? You'd probably have a better chance of getting that information from God than this game. In fact, Hektor hardly explains anything properly. The game conveys its tale singularly through badly written journal or diary entries that are randomly distributed throughout the entire level in a humdrum and erratic manner.  Walk into the intelligence room for the first time, pick up a journal entry. Walk into the intelligence room again at a later time, great there are 2 more journal entries to pick up. What the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• is this? Shouldn't the intelligence room be empty now given that I have just explored it earlier? The entire attempt feels so lazy, so half-hearted. It destroys any remaining immersion that one might have in the game up to this point. The main story is simplistic. It is also full of boring cliches. How many times can we pretend to be interested in the stories told by the people who eventually develop the 'crazies', or some aggravated form of 'stockholm' syndrome? Leave that for the bad movies, it is their rightful domain. You are supposed to be making a horror game that scares us, unnerves us, that makes the hairs on our skin stand as we uncover the story bit by bit. And this is the best you can come up with? $14.99 is too much money to spend on this utter filth and garbage. $14.99 is too much money to spend to be insulted by the developers, who think they can masquerade this bad cashgrab as a 'psychological horror game'. The only thing that is horrifying about this game is our ridiculously low expectations when it comes to paying for and hyping garbage like this on Steam. If you enjoyed 'Daylight', which is another horror game with procedurally generated levels, you might enjoy Hektor. They are both equally bad. Another option is to skip both games, and simply watch a let's play from one of the better youtubers out there. It will require a considerable amount of good acting skills on the part of the youtuber to beat some life into this dead dog's body.Otherwise, FASTER FASTER... avoid Hektor. You have been warned.\",\n",

O jogo √© muito pesado,se voc√™ n√£o tem um PC com muita mem√≥ria nem tente pois seu PC pode explodir kkkkkkkk. Existem √°reas que voc√™ pode explorar,por seu um jogo aberto,por√©m s√£o √°reas dominadas por cl√£s ou at√© mesmo √°reas de seus inimigos,a menos que voc√™ seja forte e furtivo,poder√° TALVEZ chegar em sua √°rea vivo,caso contr√°rio,voc√™ ser√° alvo f√°cil. Se vir um inimigo muito forte acima do seu n√≠vel,n√£o tente atac√°-lo mesmo que outros aliados seus estejam dando \"montinho\" nele na covardia,pois esses caras com certeza v√£o matar todo mundo e voc√™ que estava l√° atacando ele,vai morrer com 1 golpe s√≥,uma ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• humilha√ß√£o. N√£o fa√ßa rixa com Cl√£s,eles podem te ca√ßar por toda eternidade,inclusive te atrapalhar em miss√µes de tempo entre outros objetivos. √â engra√ßado ver por este lado,mas quando joguei de Vil√£o,muitos outros vil√µes me davam mais suporte do que quando era Her√≥i,muito her√≥is que estavam lutando comigo,quando viam que um cara era mais forte que eu,todos corriam e fugiam e te deixavam pra morrer,j√° os vil√µes os caras ficavam at√© morrer,ou seja,se for ser Her√≥i,lembre-se que vai seguir um destino sozinho como o Batman. Os gr√°ficos n√£o s√£o t√£o legais,mesmo em boa resolu√ß√£o,parecem bonecos pl√°stificados,√© tosco.',\n",
       " '-Positivo: O √∫nico MMORPG que se parece um pouco em TESV:Skyrim √© RuneScape,na qual passei mais de 5 anos jogando e pagando o member para ter acesso a todo o jogo. Muitas coisas s√£o semelhantes,inclusive a quantidade de itens. Recomendo que voc√™ tire um final de semana para jogar e que esteja livre de afazeres,pois o jogo vai te prender e voc√™ n√£o vai ver a hora passar. A jogabilidade √© boa,melhor que muitos outros jogos de RPG,inclusive pode ser comparado a jogabilidade de BF3. O jogo √© aberto e voc√™ pode explorar a vontade,mas o que mais da gra√ßa √© fazer as miss√µes,mas,nada lhe impede de sair matando todo mundo e condenar o seu Save. Possui uma vasta quantidade de formas que pode modificar o seu personagem,incluindo muitos livros que pode ler e saber mais da hist√≥ria. [E para os mais tarados,as mulheres possuem muitos decotes mostrando bastante os peitos. Existem Mods,que voc√™ pode instalar deixando as personagens nuas,mas isto √© fora do jogo. Dentro do jogo o m√°ximo que voc√™ consegue √© deixar as mulheres com um suti√£ e uma calcinha,j√° os homens ficam s√≥ de fralda kkkkkkkk.]-Negativo: Se for comprar,prefira pegar o combo de todas as DLCs,pois sim dar√° mais gra√ßa ao jogo,incluindo maior tempo de jogo,e te permitindo explorar todo o ambiente sem que tenha uma parede invis√≠vel que n√£o te permita atravessar,isso √© muito chato. Os gr√°ficos s√£o bons,nada t√£o muito ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•,mesmo jogando no Ultra. As vezes ocorre da tela cheia do seu jogo minimizar sozinha,ou at√© mesmo do nada seu jogo fechar,s√£o problemas que n√£o est√£o no seu PC,mas que s√£o do jogo e n√£o foram reparados. Ao rodar o seu jogo em qualidade altas como a Ultra,certifique-se que seu PC possua um bom Cooler ou ele ir√° queimar.',\n",

       " '0/10 - Because review scores are ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t.This game had potential but quickly turned into a Cash-grab for SMS and became a joke of an E Sports contender, with all of the community events in 2016 focusing soley on the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t E Sports market.Most cars and tracks are old models from other SMS games and the only insult to it is the price to pay for it.Some car classes are broken by the DLC cars, throwing old road cars in with old race cars or mixing F1 cars, the 72D will never keep up with the 78. AI selection is absent too, so doing a mixed field GT race will have ALL THE CARS with GT in their title in the field, ever wanted to race against a GT40 while doing the Bathurst 12 Hour in a GT4 Mustang while still having the GT3 cars to overtake you? TOO BAD!There also seems to be a load of bugs still, during online races I would often get wrecked just by tapping wheels, one time even being wrecked because the game glitched the grid, placing another car under me.The FFB took me a year to get to a level where I could enjoy driving it, being a confusing mess and I only sorted it when I stopped using FFB setups that would be considered \"Normal\" in my other wheel-based games.AI is great in this game, aside from a few bugs that have the AI pit on the last lap of a race if it starts raining (which ruined a perfect enduro race I staged) but aside from a few buggy classes of vehicles, most of the rest can kerb-hop and battle for position sometimes, if the game doesn\\'t go and supercharge them like it is prone to do.You can have some fun with this game, offline it is a decent simcade mode.As I have said before with other racing sims, wait until the second game and even then, give it a few months before buying this one to see if the 2nd game can be improved over this mess, which could have cornered the Gran Turismo for PC market that some of us have been waiting for since GT turned to crap.',\n",
       " \"0/10 - Because review scores are ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•tCodies latest rally sim is exactly that, a proper sim... for the most part.The cars are mostly from DiRT 3 with a few extra cars thrown in but they were chosen in DiRT 3 for a reason and they all seem in place here.I do club rallying myself and D.R is exactly that, it's basically racing old WRC cars in semi-pro events that somehow pay major dollars, you end up doing the same stages over and over again so I recommend playing this game about once every two weeks rather than just sitting down and playing the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• out of this game.The stages are really 6 locations with 2 massives stages cut up into pieces, now, in a club rally we do this all the time but even then in real life the stages are all 20km long. D.R feels like a rallysprint but this also allows a few more people to complete events. The monthly challenges can be up to 2 hours long - That's a regular rally on a Saturday night for most real drivers.The game itself is graphically lovely, the physics are insane and show just how good Codies can make games.But nothing can replicate the amazing terror of throwing yourself through a dark forrest on a logging trail that was only driven on the last time you had a rally there. (and I'd love for Codies to come to Australia and make you sim racers have a go at some of our stages)This was plainly thrown together to get a CMR style title back into the mainstream press and now that it's released the 2nd game will most definitely be a WRC game with a car and stage list to make you think back to the old CMR days, Having some old oddities of cars would make a nice addition to the seemingly standard car list that lands in every rally game.Beast of a game that punishes you for mistakes.\",\n",

Sorry but there is just to much to enjoy to recommend it. Not to mention the constant regular updates and bug fixes, really it's just terrible that these people are actually DOING stuff to improve the game. A real shame indeed.In all seriousness ARK has plenty to offer to those who don't cry when they lose dirt in Minecraft.

I didnt play it more often after 1-2 years afterwards i\\'ve goten it, and only recently have i\\'ve discovered the ranking system. I was so pumt about it, and started to play it as recent as March. that\\'s when I started to play competitive and realized how absaloutly ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• the community is. And dont get me started on the cooldown ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• they\\'ve implemented in.  So whats with the community?  I\\'ve seen many reviews about this game, and mostly it\\'s all about Russain\\'s and tk and Russain\\'s and more Russian\\'s and more Russian\\'s and it continues on. I\\'ve never had any problems with Russain gamers (most likley it\\'s due to me living in Australia) but they are right about teamkilling, team-stealing, the obsured amount of smurfs/trolls, and the mind ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• if \"hackers\" in the game. I cant get through one game without raging like a pyscho monkey on crack. There is a lot of cheaters in this game, but its just total ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t how the community wants to put this game in the grave.   Why dont you just report the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s?  trust me, it don\\'t work  What\\'s the \"competitive cooldaown\" and why do you hate it?    OMFG DON\\'T GET ME STARTED ON THIS ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•!  I\\'ve never thought that this good of a comapany would put the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•es thing into an already perfect game.

       " \" 6/10 TL;DR: Great visuals, very immersive soundtrack, unique detective concepts. No main-storyline, no ending. Puzzles were way too easy. Cases are predictable. This game honestly took a huge step back from The Testament in terms of storyline, but a huge leap forward in gameplay.Great visuals, Baker Street/Whitechapel has greatly improved over The Testament. Voice acting is well done (accents), but lip-syncing is pretty disappointing for next-gen gaming. Very unique game mechanics with new interesting concepts like Imagination and Sherlock Talent. The only downside to these is that the game tells you directly where your targets are, which just kills the fun. It'd be better if the Sherlock Talent just gave the game a filter or texture that makes it easier to see objects of interest, rather than make them glow.6 in-depth very intriguing, however, very predictable cases. It's a great improvement over The Testament, which was more like an interactive movie. This game allows you to not only make your own deductions, but make your own conclusions, choose your own guilty party and make your own moral choices as to how you will covict them. No main storyline (except for  The Merry Men terrorist group  ), which is HUGELY disappointing, especially in a Sherlock adaptation. I loved how The Testament was all one case and was full of plot twists and in depth dialogue and story. Overall, this game feels half-finished but  is definitely worth your time  if you are into the more thinking-based games that require your full attention/patience.\",\n",

The loading times and setup however is pretty ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•-poor. I've spent 16 hours in-game, most of which are probably spent joining servers and loading up the game. The graphics/animations were nice. Original textures and decal, detailed landscapes and maps. Animations are mostly consistent. It has a unique fighting engine, having an anatomical damage-system instead of the normal health based system, like the Overflow indie engine. The physics are a bit off, seeing a lot of bugs and glitches here and there but that's okay for a game still in it's beta stage. Controls were fairly simple, hard to pickup but very satisfying when I got the hand of it. The community at times can be painful to put up with, witnessed first hand on many accounts people taking over servers and changing the game-modes (Free-duels to FFA). Full of obnoxious kids ignoring game rules, leaves me exiting the game frustrated every time. I only bother with higher level servers, although I don't fit that criteria, is the only games that have players who give two ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• about the quality of gameplay. I'm sure there will be a more in depth story-line to come in the future, but for now it's not fair to hold the game against it.\",\n",

The swimfin acts like the scarf, and while the scarf in journey lets you fly, the swimfin in this game lets you swim faster for small period of time. You can collect shells to increase the size of your swimfin, so you can use it\\'s speed boost for more time.Something i notused is that even when i got hit by \"enemies\" (lets just call them enemies so i don\\'t spoil anything) my swimfin didn\\'t seem to get shorter, which kinda disappointed me.  ControlsThe controls are very nice, intuitive and responsive,  WITH EXCEPTION of the camera, which can be a hassle to control sometimes. (Keep in mind im using a Xbox One controller) GraphicsAs you\\'ve probably seen in the trailer, the graphics of this game are pretty. I personally don\\'t like the graphical style they chose (simpler textures), but that varies from person to person. GFX are VERY nice, reflections and lighting look amazing, but i\\'d say they\\'re not as good as they were in Journey, especially lighting. (Please keep in mind im playing in maxed settings in 4K) PerformanceThis game runs somewhat good, but it has its issues. Im using a GTX 1080 and Intel Core i7-4790K, and as stated before, im running Abz√ª on maxed settings in 4K. My highest framerate was 72fps, lowest was 24fps and average was 51fps. Im gonna go and say this game could have ran better if it wasn\\'t a console port, but what can we do, right? SoundThe sounds and noises creatures make are exceptional, and props to whoever recorded/edited/made them. Background noises are also very good, but they could have been done better. SoundtrackThe soundtrack, just like Journey\\'s soundtrack, is FREAKIN FANTASTIC, all the songs match the ambient and the situation you are in, giving the game an awesome cinematic feel. Im gonna have to say that (at least in my opinion) Journey\\'s soundtrack is better.  GameplayThe gameplay feels very fluid, activating objects doesn\\'t interrupt you (mostly), and there are no parts which abruptly get too slow or too fast, disrupting the experience. A thing i\\'d like to point out is that Abz√ª has nowhere near as much \"Wow\" moments like in Journey, whereas you are amazed at least once every level, and some animations feel weird, for example, StoryDon\\'t worry, im not going to spoil anything. Just like in Journey, the story is kind of vague, there\\'s not much context or objetive. Abz√ª is A LOT shorter than Journey, so much in fact, that i was kinda disappointed when it was over. FinalizationWell, by reading my review so far, you\\'d say i recommend Abz√ª. And i do. Kind of... If you came here for the same reason that i did, for an improvement over Journey, im sorry, but this isn\\'t it. Don\\'t get me wrong, Abz√ª is a great game by itself, but it wasn\\'t up to my expectations, especially because it was developed by the same developers that developed Journey.',\n",
       " \" After completeing all the levels with the main protagonist, here is my review. 8.5/10 The games random elements keep thing interesting, but I find myself cysling through the rng untill I find one that is a little easier. It does help the game stay fresh when you are repeating a level generally several times.The difficulty starts relatively high and only continues for the most part as the game progresses.If you find the first level frustratingly difficult and have played less than 2 hours, consider gettign a refund as it only gets harder.Level design is wonderful with enough variety that even though the game never changes its machanics it doesn't get boring. With the difficulty so high you genuinally feel a sense of achievement when a level is completed.The artstyle while simple is brilliant as is the sound design.

Although we only have Episode One as of this review, it's safe to say that Telltale has done an incredible job and I cannot wait to see more episodes and perhaps even future seasons.  Pros  Immersive as hell. The atmosphere, story, character development, everything was amazing.  Detective work. Incredible voice acting all around. Really digging Troy Baker as Bruce Wayne/Batman. It's a Telltale Batman game. That speaks for itself. Fight scenes in this are amazing. Camera angles, the intensity, everything about them make you feel like the Batman.  Choosing your plan of attack is awesome. Hope to see this feature used more in future episodes.  Cons   Performance issues. Won't dwell on this too much, has already been discussed to death. Not really a con but, first episode was a little slow paced. I personally didn't mind this but some may be a bit put off by the large amount of dialogue. Overalll Score: 8.5/10.Once future patches are released that deal with the current performance issues, I Strongly reccomend purchasing this. Personally, it is my favourite Telltale Game since the first season of The Walking Dead. Adding on from that, not everyone will face issues with running the game so I strongly suggest getting it to either give it a go or just wait until the patches roll on out. Strongly reccomend this game, get it whenever, you most likely won't regret it.\",\n",

THE GOOD STUFF The gameplay is exciting, I often find myself on my toes, always alert for the \"Monster has startled the birds icon\" I couldn\\'t wait to spring into action with my team mates. Playing as the monster is just as exciting, always on the prowl, sniffing out your enemies as you devour the wildlife and become so powerful, the hunters become the prey.The classes the game provides (Assault, trapper, medic and support). Everyone has their own job and if one falls, the hunters may find it difficult to survive. The class system makes it important for Teamwork to exist within the game, making it a very good game to play with friends.Even on low graphics (had to turn it down due to optimization issues, more on that later) the game looks great, enviroments are lush and the dark, gloomy time setting makes the games atnosphere that much better THE BAD STUFF I\\'ve read other reviews and forums and it seems that alot of people are having issues with the game, even with powerful systems, admitedly my system isnt \\'Top Tier\\' but it\\'s no scrap yard and I was having issues running the game on High, to get a smooth, enjoyable experience I had to turn the graphics down to Low. However I didn\\'t expect much less, it is in Alpha after all.The loading times took ALONG time, I mean 10-15 minutes long just to get into a bloody level! I kept having audio issues, gun sounds repeatedly going off when I wasn\\'t firing etc, quite irritating THE CONCLUSION It\\'s good, its very good....FOR AN ALPHA, you need to keep that in mind when playing something that isn\\'t a full release, the devs have already said they are continuing to add on to this game and have a very clean, polished game out in Febuary.I highly recomend this, unfortunately I am writing this on the last day, I will ofcourse try to get a couple more hours in, so lets hope the full game is as pleasant as this.',\n",

It\\'s hard to care about the characters in this game when they come in two flavours, hackers and people you need to rescue from hackers.

For example, in one of the first few missions, I was running along when I run into this huge ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• scorpion thing that comes out of the ground and shoots a giant reflective ball at me. Naturally, I move out of the way of the ball and look to where it lands and realise that it just created terrain. I swear I spent about 15 minutes just screwing around with what was now my new best friend and making what was once a grassy plain into a deslote wasteland full of mountains. Its that sort of thing that makes me love this game. Not to mention, not long after that mission, you get a powerup that lets you shoot, get this: THE BALLS THE FREAKING SCORPIONS CAN SHOOT. That point is the happiest any game has ever made me feel. However this powerup is a little unbalanced, as it does ridiculous amounts of damage AND is AOE.

While he surprisingly survived the incident, he was crippled from the waist down and confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life, subjecting him to further mental trauma which drove him into becoming reclusive and spiteful of his own life. Doctor Purnell was assigned as Simon's psychiatrist following the accident, and using Cognitive Therapy, Simon was instructed to write a book about his emotions and anxiety to get all the trauma out of his head. Simon and PurnellPurnell talking with Simon about his treatment.Simon authored the book as instructed and the events of Cry of Fear begin - the events unfolding being a metaphorical depiction of Simon's mind and his battle to purge his inner demons through writing, the actions taken during the game showing how well the therapy works.The Simon played as over the course of Cry of Fear is in fact a mental projection of Simon and what combats the trauma inside the real one's mind. The fate of both Simons depends on what ending is unlocked due to the actions made during the game.^ That may be a lot but that mostly is Simon's background.- This game also carries some good Co-op experience, meaning that the co-op is pretty fun and shares another story about how the Police is trying to find Simon to help him out and take him somewhere to get help while you go on a wild adventure meeting some creepy things. \",\n",

       " \" Darksouls Scholar of the First Sin   Darksouls Scholar of the First Sin  was ment to be 20x harder I only found it a bit harder then the original but  in the ways they made it harder they also made it easier. New players just picking up darksouls 2 Scholar of the First Sin will have a hard time because the enemies just swarm you its not 1 enemy then 1 enemy etc etc like it was in darksouls 2. OVER ALL SCORE  Hardness   7.5/10 - Much more difficult with the addition of more NPC invades altho they removed a lot of features from 2 (to try and balance it out). Players that are new to darksouls (Haven't player the other 2) will find this really hard  Enjoyment  8/10 - I had a lot of fun playing thing over it was fun knowing that the enemies were in different places  and i didnt really know what to expect. Allt hough it was still darksouls 2 but changed it a bit more so not as fun as picking up a new souls game and doing a blind run\",\n",
       " ' DayZ Standalone After roughly playing this game for 20 hours i have enjoyed it so far, Although my review is going to be washed down by all the negetives i just want get my review out there. DayZ Standalone has been in early access for about 3 years and some people just dont read the note displayed on the DayZ Standalone Steam Page WARNING: THIS GAME IS EARLY ACCESS ALPHA. PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE IT UNLESS YOU WANT TO ACTIVELY SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT OF THE GAME AND ARE PREPARED TO HANDLE WITH SERIOUS ISSUES AND POSSIBLE INTERRUPTIONS OF GAME. As a short answer I would say dont buy the game until its fully out or in beta unless you want to face countless glitches such as zombies running trough walls and triple hitting. In DayZ Zombies are the least of your worries, you can play as a legendery hero or a bandit. I have been held as hostage 3 times already. You can also play a role playing version of Dayz, I haven\\'t touched DayZRP but you can play it here http://www.dayzrp.com/ Pro\\'sRealistic unlike some other zombie-survival games.Really big map that takes alot of your time and does not keep you board.Balanced weapons.Thats really it i cant remember anything else :3 Con\\'s Really hard to meet new people as they might kill you or hold you hostage.Really hard to find ammunition because all millitary bases/police stations are lootedEverywhere is looted if you play on a server with heaps of people. Conclusion Anyone who says DayZ Standalone is dead, or that the developers have \"taken the money and ran\", or that the community is dead, quite frankly is full of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. The game is very much alive and so much better than it was when it started. Even though DayZ SA has been slow off the start compared to other survivalist games (H1Z1, Rust, ARK, Unturned, Miscreated, etc), I strongly believe it will come out on top as the best survivalist game when it is finished. No other survival game has this much attention to detail and realism as DayZ. No other survival game has the kind of studio resources and money that Bohemia has to put out a strong title. No other survival game has mastered the hardcore aspect of survival and struggle better than DayZ. Almost every other survival game was rushed out on a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Unreal engine in an effort to reap money off the survivalist scene and try to outbeat Bohemia to the punch on features and gameplay. Games like Rust and H1Z1 fail to hit the bullseye on what a survival game should be. DayZ Standalone does this right and does it good. I would definitely recommend this game now, as it\\'s about to surpass the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• outta all other games on the market. Go out there and start surviving! But be warned of the glitches. Thanks for reading!  I also might make a fps boost guide for DayZ! EDIT : I made a DayZ FPS Boost guide https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=675608086',\n",

       " \" Disciples Sacred Lands and Disciples II .. are some of the best turned based strategy games out there to date and they are .. old.. almost as old as Tactics Ogre, FF tactics, or Kingdom Under Fire. Not a lot of game companies can completly screw themselves out of a winning formula.. but they did it.. boy did they do it. If you ever played Koudelka another turned based game also made in 1999. You will see how they flip flopped the entirety of the battle machanic to something less desirable than the 2 original games from 99 and 02. I personally considered the static grittiness and archaic battle system far greater than most others.  And where's my flags? The genius of simplicity in the originals far outweighed the more advanced or presentable offerings than most current turn based games at that time. However the Hex design is done quite well. Even better than most Heroes games. What really irks me is the way the combatants hit eachother.. and theres no blood and guts.. like it was in the old game. When the enemies struck eachother..  it almost felt as if you were being struck or shot or blasted.. this just has a very poor way of illustrating a strike to an enemies body compared to the old game. A Town a TOWN my kingdom FOR A TOWN .. where is it? .. i could barely stomache 15 minutes before quitting on the second mission. I'll just hold it down and play through it.. but wheres my towns?.. I guess that's the price we pay for such stunning graphics.. oh well.. I really hope this game series.. GOES BACK .. to the original design that won them praises from even the most hardcore turned based strategies.. guess I'll just go play Xcom.. or Massive Chalice.. or maybe even reload that old campaign from Disciples 1 or 2.\",\n",
       " ' DotA 2 Review  Introduction DotA is a game developed by Valve Corporation and is the second installment for the Defence of the Ancient series.  It\\'s Avaliable for all current platforms and is playable on all of them although there is a few bugs and perfromance issues for Apple Computers. Development of DotA started in 2009, when the original developer IceFrog were hired by Valve. Overview DotA is  a MOBA (Multiplayer online battle arena) that relys heavliy on teamwork and communication.  Dota is played in matches with 2 teams with 5 players on each team, both teams have a base they need to defend in the corner of the map. The objective is to attack the enemy team and to destroy there Ancient before they destroy yours. During a match every player is able to control 1 out of 112 playable \"Hero\" character that all have different Skills, Abilities and Play Styles. During the match the player is able to collect gold by killing creeps or other heros and using the gold on buying items from a shop thats located in different areas of the map. History Dota was first developed by IceFrog as a mod for Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos. It was praised by the community for it\\'s gameplay and Production quality.  It was then brought back to life by Valve in a sequel as we know it by today called DotA 2. Since it was first released DotA was featured at several world tournaments. At one point it was the most popular and most discussed free, non supported game mod in the world.  Gameplay DotA 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game that is three dimensional graphical environment. There a 2 teams named Radient and Dire. Each team has 5 players and can each choose from a pool of 112 Heros. The player can level up there hero by killing creeps/neutrals or heros and then will recieve gold which they can spend on items in the shop. There hero levels up by gaining XP (Experience) which will make the hero become more powerfull. Whenever a hero gains a level the player may unlock/levelup a ability for there hero to use. Each hero is influenced by it\\'s primary attribute: Strength, Agility or Intelligence. Graphics Dota has had a update about 3-4 months ago that updated the engine to Source 2 which was the first Valve game to use the Source 2 engine. Before the source to update the graphics were very virbant and had good colour but not good depth and shadow to to surroundings and to the heros themselfs. Now since the Source 2 engine has came out the map and heros look amazing and everything has amazing detail to them. In the \"new\" Source 2 engine they have great setting options for low budget, not the greatest performance computers, to custom built computer\\'s that have the ability to max out every setting. The Video tab includes a simple slider to adjust all graphical options in one or to tick or uncheck boxes that are best suited for your computer. Conclusion In my opionion DotA is the best MOBA out at this moment and has captured the minds of thousands and is the top played steam game on the steam charts. I would reccomend to all to have a go and see what you think. Even after my 590 hours of DotA 2 i still havent got a hang of everything and there is still lots to learn and the communitiy are very willing to teach you. Although it has a steep learning curve once you get the hang of the game it can be truly satisfying playing with a team or by yourself with randoms and working as a team to kill the enemy\\'s ancient.

       " \" Examples of flaws in this game I told my dwarf to fill a tiny gap in the mine but he decided to moonwalk and drop to his death in a pit of lava.(Not going to lie, pretty fancy way to die)Every so often you get a  wave   horde  of enemies that attack you to keep the game a challenge. But if today is not your day, then you can simply place some dirt combined with some ladders (to  really  confuse them)  in their path and you've fixed the problem, they wont be able to pass. SImple as that.  An entire freaking army blocked by DIRT   kinda sad The local wildlife are all phycologically unstable, and thus have come to realise living is not an option. Most animals commit suicide through drowning in tiny puddles across the plains. If it rains you can find corpses of deceased animals littered around.The tech tree is a cool idea, but        I dont want to make a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• roof    IM A DWARF FOR THORIN'S SAKE  WHY DO WE NEED FANCY ROOFS TO MAKE WEAPON'S OF WAR. FLOWERS AND STUFF ARE FOR ELVES.This brings me to another problem, RAIN IS LIKE FLOODS. If you decide to burrow underground you will have a free aquarium. But honestly the game is not bad.  The art style is nice, I enjoy the content and the dwarves are all adorable :3. i really wish that the devs could improve on it though. By making the characters more custumizable. If one of my dwarves die, like the one stated above, I didn't feel much 'sadness', just another dwarf that was suicidal. i just wish that each dwarf is more unique to the others, and when he gains skill level he gets power ups or miscelleanious changes, so that he is different to the lot. I enjoy the game but it sometimes becomes boring due to the tech tree which is a forced manufacture of items you will never use and are expensive to make in order to reach the things you acually want, this concept is in its primary stages and has the potential of improving the game, but at it's current state, the tech tree is more like a forced line of actions, not a choice based decision.So please devs, improve the A.I., make each dwarf more unique and special to the player, and make a better tech tree.\",\n",

       " \" Great game, for its time I remember when BioShock first came out and me and my older brother were in awe at how amazing it looked as the plane crashes into the ocean and flames engulf your vision in that opening cut-scene, we thought that this was the best looking a video game would ever get.A lot of time has gone by since then, and we were wrong, However this game is still really good and has stood the test of time. This game has a great story that can be progressed even further with the use of the audio logs scattered around the landscape and the game play mechanics are still outstanding and unique to this day, the use of plasmids and lack of ammo makes for some very thought provoking moments.The roar of the Big Daddys coupled with the soft murmurs of dialog from the Little Sisters from another room evoke a feeling of fear as you remember the last encounter that left you with little to no ammo or eve. In this game you definitely feel like you are nothing and could just be destroyed by anything any second, and this is very rare for games to do these days and is a great thing to experience.BioShock excels at evoking feelings whether it be the sadness or regret of harvesting a little sister or the nice feeling you get when you rescue a little sister and she runs off after thanking you profusely. But this game is somewhat unforgiving to you if you are yet to decide which route you want to take. Spoiler-Free Tip If you want a good ending, do not harvest any little sisters. SAVE THEM ALL.I harvested two and I was considered evil by the games standards which is something that I found disappointing as I thought there might be a system that would tally a ratio of harvests to rescues but that is not the case.Just remember: SAVE THEM ALLThere are also a few game-breaking glitches where alt+tab'ing will sometimes mess with the resolution or make it crash, I also came across a bug where the game lost 3 hours or so of save-games so I was forced back, and the game also crashed on the final cut-scene forcing me to replay the last section.Definitely worth playing, even today, you might just want to change some controls but after that you're good to go.tl;dr: Great game, even for today's standards, a bit unforgiving, and a bit buggy. Tends to crash. Still really good!\",\n",

Then send it spies to ruin their party and make other parties more strong, however good luck with that. :)If you wish to have a friend to play with, you\\'re able to do that, however be aware that the servers are not up anymore and you will be forced to host your own server through port-fowarding or using a program such as Hamachi, playing online is very interesting and is often more difficult due to the AI sometimes being very predictable.The game does suffer from bugs, game crashes and HUD bugs are very common and get worse the longer you play for one session. If the game does not even launch, it is often Steam or your system and a reinstall is very handy. Game crashes seem to get worse the longer you use a constant game copy, reinstalling this game every time crashes become common is a good idea and modding the game can also cause crashes, however I would reccomend the WW1 mod.I full-heartly reccomend this amazing game, with over 600 hours on Steam and much more off Steam, it helped me learn more in-depth about World War 2 and made me truly see the effects of the war. 9/10+Unique game with much replayability+ Extremly In-depth if you want it to be+ Able to attack a country through unique ways+ Great moding community with WW1 mods to game enhancing mods such as ICE-  Bugs, often forcing a reinstall after a unknown period of time- No official servers',\n",

The environment is VERY Doom 3-like, however I'd say the textures are much better looking. Everything else is exactly the samein terms of appearance.Gameplay-wise it is not as good. Walking is a bit floaty and you can't jump, as Space is the 'interact'button. Gunplay works really well however. While being slow to start off the game kicks you in thenuts with a big horde of zombies at the end of the first level. However while this pumps up the gamethe general gameplay is slow.Feature-wise it is very good. You can buy different items in the in-game shop with CREDITS YOU PICK UP IN-GAME. NO MICRO-TRANSACTIONS. THANK JESUS HIMSELF. Anyways, the guns in thestore seem to be varied and they look very nice. Problems: - Had minor issues with menus over-lapping while running on my 3 monitors - No jumping - Slow gameplayWould I recommend it? YEP. Remember my comment about Doom 4 having some competition? Yeah, I was being truthful. I honestly think if the devs fix the slow gameplay, walking and lack ofjumping, this could be a classic that will be remembered for years to come.Doom, watch the f**k out.NOTE: I know I go on about how this is the next Doom-killer but I really think it has the potential to be.\",\n",

END OF IMPORTANT PART  ALSO CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR MAIN GAME RestPros:- Conversations between Gaige & Axton, some humorous moments.- One new class mod for all classes (I think) that boosts Cryo damage + chance, but the skills aren\\'t that useful.- A few new weapons, which have good effects but not worth $10- 10 new levels-Some enemies seem to always drop white lasers, so you could Grind them alot or use them in \"To Arms!\"- Some nice skins, including one that is unlocked for all characters (Basically transforms your character into an Eridian version)Cons:- The soundtrack is re-used from Tycho\\'s Ribs/Eleseer- The only enemies you will face are Dahl soldiers & Eridians. The only \\'bosses\\' are Flameknuckle, a miniature Destroyer, and the powersuit Felicity. All 3 of these appear in the main game, only that you can\\'t fight powersuit Felicity.- In some rounds, you\\'ll spend more time looking for enemies than actually fighting them. If the map had less areas that \\'stuck out\\' from the main area, that\\'d make it better.- The enemies don\\'t give that much XP. If you want XP fast, go farm RedBelly.- Very bland. In other slaughterdomes, you had a great soundtrack & variety of enemies. This is a relatively boring soundtrack and about 4 or 5 different type of enemies.',\n",

It's extremely obvious in it's inspirations. The game incorporates a lot of ideas from Dark Souls, but implements them very poorly. In Dark Souls, dying to a boss is mostly due to lack of skill. In Salt and Sanctuary, however, I found many of the mechanics, and the enemy and boss AI to be poorly programmed. Rolling is unreliable, and blocking is clunky. There's very little indication of the stat requirements of the gear you'll find. Many of the attempts to create difficulty has resulted in things such as enemies and bosses that don't let you get up after being knocked down.

       " \" Recieiver Games rarely consider the details of ammunition. The amount of rounds a player carries shows up as a number in the interface, and reloading requires nothing more than tapping a button. Actually handling and managing the bullets that go into a gun is a complex task, however. Receiver, an first-person shooter (FPS) from Wolfire Games, wants to remind us of that fact. Unfortunately, it never makes it clear why we should care.Receiver drops the player into a randomly-generated set of rooftop rooms and tasks him with recovering 11 tapes of droning narration (without subtitles) and that explain the game's story. The player begins with an unpredictable loadout including one handgun in one of various states and some ammunition. The player may also start with a flashlight or, if his gun is semi-automatic, a spare magazine or two. He must then move through the multi-tiered linear world looking for the tapes, which can be frustrating since one can go through at least nine rooms in a row without encountering a single one. I myself haven't managed to get all 11 in a single playthrough before dying.The game only has two kinds of enemies: a stationary gun turret and a flying drone, both of which can kill the player with a single hit. Each has some associated visual cues, but most of the time the player will need to hear their alert chirps to know when he's been spotted and when it's safe to move. The distribution of enemies changes, and on rare occasions they can be avoided. Because enemies are difficult to evade and pickups can be hard to see, however, killing everything in a room is generally the only option.Receiver started as a response to a seven-day FPS challenge and definitely feels like it, from its spare graphics to its room-entry stutter. The hook for the game is that it presents the process of actually reloading the firearm in a significant level of detail. The HUD has no ammo count, and bullets do not magically fly from the corpses of your enemies into magazines the player can swap out every time he takes a breath. Rounds must be gathered manually and loaded into magazines by hand, with the gun safely tucked away. If there's no spare magazine, the player has to eject the empty, refill it, then shove it back home again. The only way to know the number of bullets remaining is to remember how many have been fired or check by eye.Receiver fails to establish that the complexity of gun handling matters. The detailed reloading scheme doesn't speak to the story, the aesthetic, or the other mechanics. Receiver doesn't treat aiming or shooting the weapon with the same carefulness it reserves for reloading, and doesn't fiddle much with the basics of movement, yet running and shooting are the core verbs of the game. By making the world randomly generated, the developers give up the opportunity to design encounters where efficient reloading matters. As a consequence, becoming more skilled with the game's most intricate systems doesn't make a player any more likely to succeed. Receiver's complex gun-handling mechanics are irrelevant in the context of its larger design.That's a shame, because the larger design has nothing to recommend it. The perfunctory story and low-poly world of Receiver aren't interesting to explore in their own right, much less when one must overcome the game's unforgiving difficulty. The choice to generate the world randomly might add replay value, but it also adds much to the frustration level while costing the game the ability to present rewarding encounters that highlight its unique mechanics. Receiver has a neat idea at its core, but that didn't translate into an interesting game.Final Score:  3.5   4 /10 \",\n",

       " \" Review  Pros   Unlike most logic puzzles Hexcells puzzles maintain actual difficulty levels and continually present challenges without ever involving guessing to arrive at a solved puzzle. Albeit in saying this I've found some Custom Puzzles so difficult I almost disregard logic and brute force a solution... Whilst the number of levels is limited to an extent (Each Chapter contains 6 Stages, ergo 36 levels/stages total). Hexcells has a Random Puzzle Generator function aswell as the ability to access Custom Puzzles of which are obtainable from  Hexcells Subreddit . Cons  Generated Level(s) complexity, from all the puzzles I've attempted to solve using this function/feature have all been relatively simple to solve. I believe the developer mentioned the complexity bottleneck is a consequence of the AI solver he uses to check whether a problem is solveable. However this is almost a non-issue as a result of the Custom Level Subreddit, there are some very difficult puzzles on there and there is such a large quantity of puzzles already in existence and that will be; you'll be more than occupied for hundreds of hours before you even contemplate using the Random Generate Function. Conclusion This along with the other two Hexcells games are well worth the pick-up @ their respective price points. Theoretically infinite playability as you'd be able to play Randomly Generated Levels and or Custom Levels obtained from the Subreddit as aforementioned. Rating: 8.5/10 \",\n",

       " \" Short and simple review Just completed this game and I actually had a good time with it in a nutshell even though it is short. Story (no spoilers) -The  story  was enjoyable but short and the character Delilah (who you talk to) is good fun to talk to and has a nice sense of humour including the character you play as. You are able to choose what you'd like to say or you don't even have to say anything, you can leave it and come off as rude. Talking about being rude, I managed to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• her off one time so it is possible although I don't know if it just happens as part of the story. Graphics and design  -The  graphics/art design  are stunning and the environment looks beautiful. The  animations  are nice and fluid as well. (Equipment and character animations) At times I'd get FPS drops especially with the last portion of the game. I was running it in 1080p, V-Sync, ultra settings on a GTX 680. I'm sure V-Sync was the issue there though. (Never tested the FPS)As someone who likes taking pictures of nature from time to time it really made it more enjoyable especially (due to the environment) with the camera you pick up later on in the game. You actually are able to keep those photos via sending it to your email; once you complete the game in the menu it'll say 'photos'. Tip for you guys! Sound design, music and voice acting -The  voice  acting is very good which made the experience great too! The  sound  quality is top notch too in my opinion. Personally I liked the choice of music too. In conclusion, I had a great time playing this even if it was short but I'm not sure about the price tag. I picked it up for $18USD due to the 10% off on launch at this current time but I think it should be $10-15 but I'm happy with what it's at. If it was $30 or more I'd say it wasn't worth it really.  So to wrap this up, I'll give this an 8/10. Would recommend. \",\n",

I fully understand people‚Äôs frustration with the Dev‚Äôs (Chucklefish) and how they shaped the game. The game has gone through many updates that remove core mechanics and add new mechanics, altogether the where slowing down their goal to finish the game by changing what they had already built and not focusing on what to do next with the players experience. ‚ÄúThey were just fixing stuff that did not need fixing‚ÄùAt the start of starbounds early access release I bought four copies for my mates so that we could all play on my local server. We had tones of fun exploiting bosses and endlessly reading throughout the wiki for answers. We finished the game when we hit the max rank tier. From there I played again, I started experimenting on how long the game was if you only cared about getting the highest tier armour set. But the game had exciting news ‚ÄúNightly build‚ÄùI knew that the nightly build would delete my character so I saved him. But when I entered the nightly/unstable build I saw what the Dev‚Äôs opinions were on their old stable build. They wanted to remake the tiers, they wanted to remake how you got through the game by adding quests, and overall they were controlling how you levelled through the game and scraping their old work which increased development time. - But they added a huge improvement to the rest of the game (weather, weapons etc).Starbound now has a better story and realism to what your character is doing but you don‚Äôt get the feeling of playing like you used in the old build. The game itself Starbound starts off with you choosing your character. After you have chosen you character and spent ten minutes customizing him/her to be perfect. You end up in your ship which is broken and ruined, you are then forced to go to the planet below and mine resources to fix your ship. You continue through the story crafting tiers of crafting tables to get the ‚Äúnext best thing‚Äù and completing quests. Throughout your adventure you will kill unique bosses and listen to startbounds Fantastic soundtrack! Conclusion I would suggest you to look at the games state (Current build and community) and think, is this game for me?-\\tDo I like adventure through space and finding better weapons and resources?-\\tDo I like following quests and helping NPCS be lazy-\\tDo I like pimping my house so I can show off to my friends.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Sz2zr3pZEoThis video is about the recent winter unstable update.',\n",

       " \" THE GAME Ampu-Tea OVERIEW OF THE REVIEW Another 'simulator' game trying to riding the coat tails of Surgeon Simulator. This game is tea-dious, frustra-tea-ing, and lacks quali-tea. WHAT IT'S ABOUT Ampu-Tea is a Surgeon Simulator inspired game where you are an amputee fitted with a robotic arm and are tasked with making a cup of tea. In the style of SS, you control your robo-hand to attempt assembling different kinds of teas with the mouse and keyboard. The silly control style provides a challenge to this otherwise simple task and it will test your patience and eventually lead to some chaos. MY EXPERIENCE PLAYING THIS GAME Honestly, this game was a disappointment, and I wasn't even expecting anything from it. My experience playing this game was mostly frustration, thanks to the awful controls and mechanics.There is no grip to pick up anything, so I had to rely on pushing things across the table with the hand and trying to balance cup handles around the fingers. Speaking of the fingers, grabbing with them is incredibly slow and insensitive, along with the hand rotation. It took me half an hour of messing around just to make one cup of tea because of how fragile the mugs are, how easy it is to knock the shelf off the table, the painful journey of moving the cup from each station, and how easy it is to break the arm itself.There is little variety in what types of drinks you can make, and no story or real motivation to make them except for a sticky note. The game description mentions being the son of an Earl, but I found no connection to that in the game. The achievements are (despite the shocking controls) fairly easy to get, minus the one for opening the game 500 times which I did not have the patience for. There are trading cards, but I uninstalled the game before I had enough game time to collect them.The only highlight I managed to draw from this game was being able to flip the table in rage. That's about it. I wish I had more to say. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATION In short, Ampu-Tea relies on the 'joke game' factor and being a silly game for YouTubers to play. There are no outstanding features in this game besides being pointlessly difficult and having more 'Keep Calm's and 'EPIC FAIL's than is socially acceptable. It is not worth the $4.99 price tag, but if you really want to play it, wait for it to hit 90% off  on a sale at $0.49. I personally did not enjoy this game and I would not recommend it.\",\n",
       " ' TL:DR:   overall this is a fun MMO that you can sink your life and time into hence I did almost failing a semester of university. A game of fantasy, magic, an absolutely beautiful world  and guys playing as small girls.  Create your perfect hero or heroine and go off and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• as much ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• up as you can while helping children and the elderly to gather plants. You‚Äôll lose your free time  and any remaining dignity  but it‚Äôll be a fun time. This game is worth a play especially if like me you‚Äôre waiting for Black Desert to be fully released.  This‚Ä¶ Game‚Ä¶. Almost failed a semester of University because I got addicted to it during the week of study before final exams.  10/10 worth it.  This game is amazing amounts of fun and it‚Äôs free. It‚Äôs really solid for a free game and I like a lot of others must ended up buying something from the store. I have 4 characters and 3 of them at the level cap, I just got so addicted to playing this game.  Positives:    This game is free. Holy crap. I would encourage anyone to at least try it for that.  Despite constantly high ping the game played just fine for me.  Pretty much everything you can buy with real money can be bought with in game gold too so if you can afford to buy stuff in game you don‚Äôt have to spend any IRL money.  I was able to create a guild called Westside Weeaboos and that‚Äôs the best thing ever.  want to be a cute elf girl?  I know I sure do. Heh.  Then this is it, create and customise your perfect doppelganger That looks nothing like the real you lol nerd   People are reasonably helpful and nice at least of PvE servers I played on. Sometimes you get some salty people when you party for end game dungeons though.   Negatives:    No servers outside of Europe and North America. I believe there used to be an Oceania server at one point but not anymore. Despite that though the game generally played very well.  A lot of busy work so things like fetch quests and kill this type quests. Which is something most MMO‚Äôs suffer from.   I don‚Äôt know if I like this or not but skill specialisations exist where you can only specialise in one thing at a time meaning you need to rely on guilds, market or friends to craft items to use in your specialisation.  Some launcher issues with the game.  (TL;DR/ Conclusion at the top)',\n",
       " ' TL;DR:   Fun little builder where playing with friends/ online can be summed up with ‚ÄúYou hit my ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing space station you massive ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚Äù and gathering resources is often more of a battle than you‚Äôd expect. Often fun to build stupid structures or just mess around with other people you play with. Picked it up for just over 20 Australian rupees on sale and was totally worth it. This is a great build and gather type game, think of it like 3D Terraria in space. You can play in a sandbox where you can build structures to your hearts content or in a survival type mode where you must gather resources in order to build things. The game is pretty fun with other people and the community support means you can get blue prints and mods that can be added without messing around with a third party mod manager. There have been a few bugs along the way but the developers are pretty good with fixing those as they know about them (The game is early access, after all). The base maps are pretty solid too. I‚Äôve played mostly on the earth one and so far I have managed to get to mars, the moon and an alien planet as I believe these were all there was when I was playing. In short, if you can spare USD 25 (Or, if like me you‚Äôre Australian the USD-AUD is pretty crappy right now so that‚Äôs 35 dollarydoos) then this is a great little game solo and even more fun with others.',\n",

Not dynamic enough, I\\'ve found myself winning galaxy after galaxy... And that gets kinda old after a little while... I bought this game back in the days when it was expensive (Alpha), and they gave us a pair of crappy commanders that are buyables, they weren\\'t even novelty. They really don\\'t care or listen to their fans, so they released \"Titans\" even when we told them it would be better off a DLC or something. My Message To UberStep up and take responsibility, your fans aren\\'t here to wipe your asses with dollar bills. Instead Of This Piece Of Expensive Poop, Go Buy These Games On another note, I\\'d highly recommend Supreme Commander 1 & 2, Executive Assault and Earth 2160 instead of this thing, they\\'re cheaper and better made. You\\'ll see where the idea for this game came from. Maybe even Space Engineers if you just want planets! Peace Out Bruh ',\n",

       " \" The game that gave me endless fun years ago. I've played this since 2011 (Gmod 12) but I don't play it as much anymore but I have to say, for someone my age back then, this game was such a blast and I couldn't stop playing it. I remember booting up singleplayer and then downloading stuff off the Toybox seeing what people have created and uploaded including myself uploading a save of a VW Golf and a Nissan 350z and reading comments; Anyway, then I'd download mods off https://garrysmods.org/ and I'd have to figure out how to install them as a 11-12 year old who was new to installing things haha. I'd even mention this game to friends at school and show my friends if they were over. Also I made an abundance of friends playing this game online. Many laughs and tears. :') I've met lots of great people through it. Looking back at my screenshots off my old computer is always giving me nostalgia of the fun I had.This game gave me lots of joy and I can't thank it enough. And it still does when I load it back up and give it a go nowadays. This game has improved in many ways. I really do recommend this game. It is great fun and you can do whatever you like with it! :) Thanks for reading!  Here is the first video I ever made of the game back in 2011 (currently unlisted and due to old YouTube channel) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yAJG1HhU2g \",\n",

       " ' This game is a joke. Warface is a try-hard, want to be Call of Duty with clunky, awful gameplay whilst trying (and failing) to implement tactical features and functions. Warface also has one of the worst Pay-2-Win systems I have ever experienced and actually makes me cringe to the core. There is an in-depth review below but the bottom line is; Don\\'t play it. In-Depth Review  Gameplay Like I said above, the gameplay is clunky and doesn\\'t \"flow\" well. I often find that sprinting makes my screen clanky and jagged and when I shoot my weapon it seems too.....rough? Pardon my low-effecient vocabulary. Tactical Play (with some community banter) One of the tactical features in Warface is to help one of your poor-tasted buddies onto a higher ledge and vice versa. I don\\'t think the Devs knew how sh*t their games community was going to be (hint: it\\'s very similiar to COD, maybe even worse) These features seem tacky and useless, used just to add some \"innovation\" to their game. Pay-2-Win Never in my life have I played a game where I have to RENT an ingame gun and not have the choice to keep it permanently, despite all those hard-earned game duckets I spent on it. Note: I haven\\'t played that much of the game and do NOT have a full understanding of the market system. EZ game EZ life I\\'m really bad at Call of Duty, like awful, so I assumed that I would be bad at this also, that was until I went on a 15 kill streak in my first game. I know the majority of FPS is all just \"point-n-shoot\" but come ON FAM, THIS IS TOO EASY! Theres next to no recoil control or bullet drop, you can kill some nerd across the map with a couple of well placed bullets from the standard, beginner assault rifle and the slide feature allows any skirken to slide inbetween my legs and topple me even if he has awful aim NO SOUTH-PACIFIC REGIONAL SERVERS WTF!?!?! Crytek seems to think the world is a weird, pacman sort of shape because they apparently don\\'t know New Zealand, Australia, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa etc exist because they didn\\'t create any f*cking dedicated servers for them, this is a personal issue but it should be resolved regardless of how bad the rest of the game is. The Wrap-Up Game is bad, play Blacklight instead (That game is rad)',\n",

       " \" What is Counter Strike: Source? It is a multiplayer first-person shooter which is a remake of the original Counter Strike that focuses on the teams of Counter-Terrorists against Terrorists, this game includes plenty of maps including some well known maps such as de_dust2 with the gamemode of Bomb defusal and cs_office having the gamemode of Hostage rescue.This game involves quite a bit of skill unlike other first-person shooters out there which can be hard to get used to. How it Works This game takes quite a bit of skill as said previously, it requires knowledge and understanding of the game. This can mean learning the economics of the game, from nade usage to shooting and compnesating spray control. As you progress you will start to learn these things. Learning is what makes this game longer-lasting and more enjoyable than other first-person shooters. Popular Gamemodes  Bomb Defusal This is a gamemode with the main objective where the Counter-Terrorists try to prevent the Terrorists from planting at either Bomb sites A or B. There are 2 ways that will give you victory, as Counter-Terrorists you can eliminate the enemy team or defuse the bomb before it explodes. When playing as Terrorist you can win doing the same thing as the Counter-Terrorists which is eliminating the enemy team or planting the bomb and letting it explode. Hostage Rescue A gamemode which has hostages that are placed where the Terrorist spawn, same concept with the wiping out enemy team but instead of the Terrorists objective to plant the bomb, it is the Counter-Terrorist to rescue the hostages and take them back to where the Counter-Terrorists spawn. Custom Gamemodes Lastly in Counter Strike: Source you will be seeing a lot of custom maps and servers which make up majority of the servers nowadays. These gamemodes go from minigames to bhop and surf with plenty of other custom gamemodes to chose from. Custom gamemodes are especially fun to play when you are bored or just looking for something to play with your mates. Conclusion Well worth buying it if it goes on sale a little bit cheaper as it is a little old and not worth the $20 at the moment. Worth all the 200+ hours on this game however there aren't as much servers as they use to be because it is getting old and there are mods that are available which are a load of fun to play such as Jailbreak and Zombies. Hands down the best game for its time and maybe even today (at least for me). I do recommend this game to those who are thinking of purchasing it although you better purchase it soon as servers are getting wiped. Although if you are still wanting the Counter Strike Experience you can switch over to CS:GO (Counter Strike: Global Offensive). Its a good alternative but I still prefer Counter Strike: Source over it9.5/10\",\n",

       " ' Written for an assessment at  SAE Institute Brisbane! [sae.edu.au] I myself am an avid player of immersive space simulators, and Rodina is a simple, yet brilliant addition to my much beloved genre. Rodina is already full of great features, and has excellent potential in terms of the endless possibilities for the modding side of it. Even though Rodina consists of only one system, it has the potential to habitat so much inside of it.The flight and combat in the game is very enjoyable. The movement is all inertia based, and the weapons look and feel amazing. Shooting down enemies high and the atmosphere, and watching them fall out of view, knowing that you could fly all the way down there and find some wondrous mountain range where the ship crashes, makes the game feel extremely grand. Its story is basic at first, but I suspect it will later develop, which gives purpose to exploring and fighting the large amounts of enemies. The feeling of flying straight out of space and onto a planets surface, while dealing with the fear of burning up in the atmosphere build so much tension and requires focus, particularly on the higher difficulties. Once you are on the surface, and have fought off any enemies in the area, you can land and walk around your ship and the planet, you can even edit the layout of your ship. You can see some great sights exploring on the surface of planets, though, in its current state the surface of a planet/asteroid/planetoid gets a bit repetitive after a while. As with most immersive space games, watching the day start, go by, and end on an alien planet is something that gets most immersive space game fans worked up (and anyone who enjoys something beautiful), what makes it even better is knowing that you can go do it all again on another planet.This game is already a great experience, for a very low price, even if a short lived one. I am excited to see it as it progresses through development, and we get to see some more incredible sights from an alien system.',\n",

       " '\"5 STARS! A+! 4 MORE STARS!\" is wah i wish i could say for this game. now dont get me wrong, this game is phenomenal, but there are issues.firstly the good:-the graphics:for an indie game, this game looks awesome! the enemies are varied and unique (most of the time), the particle effects are spot on, and the backdrops are beatiful. i\\'d put them in a frame if i had a printer.-the music: it is again, very good. a very ambient, but somewhat blood-pumping sci-fi alien (almost metroid like) soundtrack. pretty much my favourite bits would be the guitar riffs in level 1 :)-the Gameplay:solid movement and hit detection. i never over estimate a jump. little to no glitches. and a fool proof way to stop people from farming the same mobs endlessly (that difficulty meter that fills as you spend more time in a stage. GENIUS.)and did i mention mulltiplayer. because that is important. this game is worlds bette rwith multiplayer as you and your frined muck about and get killed. alot.now the bad...-graphics arent everything and in a game where the very asthectic is a simple but appealing 32 bit pixel asthetic, its hard to complain. but in later levels of the game (or just later difficulties)i would continually lose myself in the swarm of mobs and lose a chunk of my health because i couldnt see my tiny-as-an-atom charecter amongst all of these behemoths who were similarly colured, and end up accidentally jumping off a platform.-the difficulty meter/timer is, as i said earlier: genius. but it fills a little too quickly. during the early hours of the game i found myself getting crushed by mobs as they were continually getting stronger at an alarming rate, while i  was struggling to pick them off. if i may present a solution to this problem: allow the player to pick how quickly they want the difficulty meter to filleasy mode might be 8 mins to get from very easy > easy, normal can be the standard time, and hard can be 2-3 minutes between difficulties.------so despite the minor flaws with the game (and me sounding a little pretentious during this review), this game is definiteley worth your time for those who have never tried a rogue-lite game before. the multiplaayer is a great way for you to learn with a friend, and once your done learning, you\\'ll see theres more depth, more challenge, than what you were already presented with (and you already had alot to begin with!)4/5 stars :)',\n",

       " '\"A guy once told me one time, \\'Don\\'t let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat coming around the corner\\'\", This is a quote from the famous heist film \"Heat\" to which PAYDAY: THE HEIST and PAYDAY 2 both used ideas from to create near flawless heisting games. PAYDAY 2 has elements of stealth, carefully intwined with elements of brutality to get the job done, one moment stealing paintings, the next setting up a thermite drill to break into a bank\\'s vault. i have had the game since release and finally decide to review it. If you are a fan of heist films (or even if you aren\\'t) i highy advise you to buy this game, also, give the less popular first game a spin too.10/10',\n",
       " '\"A man chooses; a slave obeys.\" Rapture is a vibrant fantasy world beyond your wildest dreams - it something to be remembered because it was so unique. The imaginative world is very dark, mature and dystopian. Grim tidings indeed. An astonishing philosophical journey - and an elaborate comment on free-will - accentuated with an incredibly enthralling and equally chilling 1950\\'s time capsule.The gameplay itself is the oriented towards survival horror but warped by intense action. This means that resource management is imperative and tactical play is emphasised.  I still consider BioShock to be Ken Levine\\'s magnum opus; BioShock is one of the most exquisite and compelling arguments for games as art. Overall, a poetically beautiful game that is a striking testament to the best gaming can offer. ',\n",
       " '\"Ah, Team Fortress 2, why are you so addicting?\" is what I say to myself all day - everyday. This excellent game is addicting and                           I                              mean addicting.I\\'ve spent over 2000 hours on this game and I have no idea how I feel about that... but enough of random blab.Let\\'s begin with... What is TF2? TF2 is a popular multi-player based hat simulator (ha ha, definitely an \"original\" joke), no story mode, no single player - unless you include practice mode and being on an empty server (which is unlikely depending on your location and the time you\\'re on) - the community consists of hat-crazed people, weapon-quality crazed people and Gibus [crazed] wearers.In other words, the community is crazy. Crazy but fun, that is.Don\\'t let the cartoony styled graphics drive you away from the game because they are actually quite nice and fit well with its 9 unique classes.So why should you get it, you ask? (Even if you didn\\'t)IT\\'S FREE TO PLAY! SO WHY NOT? Experience the game for yourself because you don\\'t have to pay a single cent and if you highly enjoy the game, then you have the option to buy it and become involved in the crazy community of hat trading.Therefore, sit yourself down, get the game and waste many hours of your life on it - like the majority of us because I am certain that you will enjoy those wasted hours. I sure did. I think. Maybe. I still don\\'t know how I feel. Anyhoo, I give a 5/5 for this fun-filled game. (Keep in mind that it can also be rage inducing).',\n",

Verdun is the first (to my knowledge) multiplayer FPS set in a realistic First World War setting, which is strangly something no one has attempted before. That being said Verdun offer a completely unique original expierence centered around immersion in a WW1 trench warfare environment. Being a bit of a history junkie myself  I found this game hard to resist and it did not disapoint.GAMEPLAY Verdun\\'s gameplay is based (mainly) around team play, providing you and 3 other players with the ability to form one of the different squad types available to each side respectivly.',\n",
       " '\"Aw jeez... where\\'s all this violence coming from? Is it the video games? I bet it\\'s the video games.\"I\\'m just going to start off with overall ratings as I know some people don\\'t like lengthy reviewsMajor aspects:Gameplay: 9/10 Very good for this style which has become so rare (a third person cover and shoot)Story line: 10/10 The best I have ever encountered, far better than even games such as the Telltale\\'s ‚ÄúThe Walking Dead‚Äù Immersion/atmosphere: 10/10 The atmosphere was incredible, this game is one of the rare games that you can truly lose yourself in.Graphics: 10/10 Despite the game being a few years old I have never seen a game with better graphics.Minor aspects:Realism: 8.5/10 Aside from the lack of friendly fire and the fact that you face hordes of enemies while surviving (though your health is relatively low), this game is rather realisticSmoothness (gameplay): 9/10 This game felt very nice to play and its only fault would be occasionally I would not duck for cover unless I pressed the button several times. Voice acting: 10/10 All the voices suit the characters very well and there is not a single voice actor that taints the immersion of the game.Player involvement (choices): 10/10 The choices were incredible, however I would have preferred it if there were a few more. Overall:I don\\'t really base the score from the minor aspects so the score (from critic point of view) is:9.75/10Though, personally, I believe this is the greatest game I have ever played and would rate it:10/10General review:When I first decided to play this game I thought it was a typical trashy shooter. This was reinforced by the single player being referred to as the \"campaign\" and even more so when the game started off with a typical Gatling gun in a helicopter scene. However, a few minutes into the game I was proven wrong, this game has the greatest storyline I have ever seen, there aren\\'t really any incredibly ‚Äútear jerking‚Äù moments as there are with games such as the walking dead, however the game still does an incredible job to connect with the player emotionally as well conveying the emotions and journey of the protagonist. Without trying to give too much away, the game also includes a variation of choices that effect the game and also lead to multiple diverse endings.The game play mainly consists of finding cover, coming up from cover and shooting enemies. Though the gameplay is repetitive the various amounts of guns, enemies terrain variations and other things, make the game continuously enjoyable. The animation of combat is very nice as well, the darting for cover and switching to different cover was a very nice animation that made the game feel extremely nice to play.The atmosphere in this game, contrasted with the outstanding graphics, creates a unique world for the player to experience. The atmosphere in this game is unlike any other shooter and truly makes you feel like a real soldier, rather than just an emotionless killing machine, this is reinforced by the two soldiers under you command that are polar opposites, I won\\'t go into that though for it would spoil a large portion of the game. Overall I cannot recommend this game any more highly, it is easily the greatest game I have every played and the only real drawback would be the length. The game has everything that you could possibly ask and so much more. IT is incredibly unique and simply extraordinary, it is definitely worth buying and playing.',\n",

       " '\"Holmes: Awakened\" is a fairly strange story, because of its themes, and its characters.At least Becker\\'s in it...You know, Becker, that show with the passive aggressive doctor? Nevermind. You\\'ll understand when you\\'re older.The game starts with you trying to solve the disappearance of a man\\'s servant. From here, the game takes off, like when Mr. Arneson\\'s hand was carried off by a raccoon. Yup, it actually happened in-game.For a start, you get use what I like to call Holmes Vision; A standard feature carried in future Holmes games.Basically, you press Shift and the screen highlights all the interactable elements available in the overworld.No more scavenging for cloths, dirt and related objects! Just press the button and pick up the stuff.Thematically, the game has various elements that differentiate it from previous games. For example, at one stage, you need to investigate a mental asylum for crucial clues. You meet a variety of...\"interesting\" characters, who help you in odd ways to help you gain access around the asylum.Not only do the characters give off their own vibe of individuality, but the Cthulu themes sure make the game ever so cryptic. Especially at the end. And that man who -- let\\'s just say \"chewed more than he could swallow\".So, characters are certainly novel, especially the disciples of The One, with their dillusional dialogue and behaviours (one guy was a cannibal). Other characters, like Lucy\\'s employer, have certain quips and remarks that make them more memorable than others.Interface is also an improvement, as they\\'ve included \"teleportation\" feature as valid travelling (unless a cutscene is required somewhere), which works by selecting a place on the map, and travelling there instantly. Plus, all dialogue between Holmes and Watson is recorded down, so you can save at a crucial moment, exit and return playing while knowing what to do. Revolutional! I found this was a major issue back in \"Holmes & the Silver Earring\", as I\\'d spend about 10 minutes trying to find out what I was doing last play session.Also, they\\'ve included an in-game guide, so whenever you get stuck horribly, you got some help nearby.Very handy for some of the trickier puzzles. The good thing is that you can choose how much of the guide to look at, so if you want a small hint in the right direction, you can get a small peek at the solution process by clicking on the arrow a small number of times.Watson is also a spooky character, sometimes.Like, I\\'m walking around Arneson\\'s house, opening doors. And BOOM. Watson\\'s standing right there on the other side, looking straight at me. Scary sometimes, but you\\'ll get used to it. Hopefully.In summary, a great improvement means a greater rating of 8/10. \"Holmes: Nemesis\" actually references this game when Barnes is found struggling on the floor, and Watson explains that it might be the book they found in this game to be the cause.',\n",

More hilarious (and occasionally strikingly poignant) writing, a great new villain, some inventive new mechanics and the introduction of super powers make this a highly enjoyable experience.

The level of freedom is wonderful, and it\\'s striking how much they are missed when they are taken away.It\\'s not flawless. There are a few bugs - such as those which instantly completed an activity for me (not that I can really complain about getting Gold level for little work, but it was jarring) and a misson-breaking bug in the Christmas DLC - the quests are unashamedly grindy at times and the game world gets unbalanced quickly once Maurauders get introduced, making it particularly hard to complete some achievements.However, this is a game which is all about fun, and it well and truly delivers.',\n",

       " '\"If god did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him\" Judging by the fact that you are reading this, you have most likely glanced at the game of which this review is about. And you may have noticed the fact the title is partnered with the ostentatious declaration of \"game of the year edition\". One of my biggest problems with this game is that it does not deserve such a title. A more appropriate accolade would probably have to simply be \"Deus Ex: Game of century edition\".Yes, that\\'s right, I found a game that\\'s better than Half-life 2, deal with it 2012 me!This is the part where one usually describes what the game is and a bit about the gameplay, but Deus ex has an exception. But, as a rule of thumb, most people classify it under the simple and undeserving title of \"FPS\", a name unworthy of such a masterpiece. This is due to the seamless blend of RPG elements, Stealth and, of course, First person gameplay of the shooting variety (and no, Fallout 3 is not a \"better example\" because Bethesda never quite grasped what the words \"role-playing\" mean, and give out skill points in as plentiful quantities as the loading time in their games due to the excessive consolization that plagues this industry like the Grey death). Of course, the game is much more complex than this, as you are not necessarily limited to sneaking around urban dystopia and secret laboratories. One can simply go in guns blazing (but this usually results in immediate death) or, in contrast, can complete the entire game without killing a SINGLE person whatsoever. The amount of choice and the way it reacts to your decisions is frightenly high.But, nothing is perfect. The gunplay is fairly weak and the graphics and animations are fairly dodgy, due to it running of the already fairly dated unreal engine. The levels, whilst very expansive and well designed, are a bit boxy and bland, even within the context of a ruined 2052 cyberpunk setting. Its true strength, however, lies within its story. Without spoiling too much it revolves around the player, a \"nano-augmented\" agent (don\\'t worry, it is kind of explained in-game) called JC Denton, who works for UNATCO (United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition), a group formed by the united nations in response to increasing global tensions, including a terrorist strike on the statue of liberty (the game was made in 2000, so it was still perfectly fine to discuss terrorist attacks on New York). But as the player fights the various organizations, he starts to realise there is something very wrong with his overlords, and finds himself a player in a secret war for world dominance. The themes, factions and events in the game are likely from a conspiracy theorist\\'s nutty dream, but simply keeping up to date wiht the state of the world simply provides foreshadowing for the dystopia presented in this game! Whilst most of the exposition and dialogue is extremely well written, its delivery and voice acting is not as refined, simply watch any play through of Hong Kong or Paris to get the idea. But, I suppose there is some charm to hearing Asian triads debate about philosophy in silly accents!On the subject of sound, it is quite obvious that the music does an excellent job of making up for the questionable voice acting. When you first boot up a game and simply get chills from the title screen, you know you\\'ve got a gem in your hands! All the the levels have an apprpaite soundtrack that suits them, with seperate themes for ambient, combat, conversations and death. Ah Hong Kong, never again will I be able to go anywhere remotely Asian without feeling like stepping into Wan Chai market for the first time...My final word is that you should absolutely buy this game. It is very cheap ($1.74 in a sale!) and there is simply no excuse for not playing this. There is a well-known phrase that \"Every time you mention Deus Ex, someone will reinstall it\", but this is complete bullocks because no one in their right mind would ever uninstall it; it is the best 700mb on their hard drive! The point being, this is easily the best PC game, if not the best overall game, ever made. It is really quite sad how no game has ever been able to match it after 14 years in terms of complexity and competency.What a shame...',\n",

After 300 hours of play, I can think of literally one or two that offered me the option to avoid, charm, or otherwise think my way out of combat. (and that is being generous) -This game is Par, if steam has neutral ratings that\\'s what this would be-This is a console game, which happens to be on PC as well...-You will still like it if you get it on PC, but you will like it a lot more on console...-You want a good RPG buy The Witcher 3, you want a adventure FPS buy Just Cause 3...or this (think boarderlands lots of shooting...very little story and dialog, or character development)-Enjoy your cultural vandalism-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Quotes from the creators of Fallout 1, 2 & New Vagas, from an interview days before release...-Interplay founder Brian Fargo: ‚ÄúOne of the edicts from the original Fallout was that you could solve every problem either by brute force, by trying to charm them or by trying to sneak your way around,‚Äù he tells us. ‚ÄúSo, to take those three options and apply them to every possible scenario, I think that was a core tenet from a design perspective of what Fallout was supposed to be.‚Äù One example was that even the final encounter with The Master in Fallout could be talked out. =&=  ‚ÄúOne of the things that I like is that they do a really good job with taking ideas that would normally be mundane and giving them a lot of personality,‚Äù -Feargus Urquhart, Obsidian CEO: \"I think people play role-playing games for the story and characters\" =&=  ‚ÄúIt was always our intention ‚Äì and we do this in all of our games, but in Fallout we did it even more ‚Äì to have interesting characters that make sense and have interesting motivations, that people can relate to. And it seems that particularly in Fallout: New Vegas people really see people like Mr. House as these real entities and not just figments of our imagination.‚Äù-Co-founder of Obsidian & author of the Fallout Bible Chris Avellone:  ‚ÄúQuest and exploration freedom that, at the least, can be accomplished by a stealthy, combat, and ‚Äútalky‚Äù character. Often, many more options are presented.‚Äù---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Summary:it\\'s still worth the money and it is a good game for what it is: an adventure FPS. This review would be positive if they\\'d just remove Fallout from the title. As they won\\'t I will judge it as a Fallout game, in which case it is a disappointment.Fallout was all about meaningful character development, fun interactive conversations and varied interesting quests, this game has none of these.',\n",

They ceased development on the PC version and have since closed down the Australian servers, making it unplayable for anyone in the area (including myself).

Some missions are for the sneaky, some for the control freaks and yet more for the just plain blood thirsty. The missions are short yet engaging, the atmosphere fun rather than immersive, and the rewards simple: More money, more guns and more masks. Yes, masks are a thing. You would have thought they were just there to hide your face wouldn\\'t you? And you would be wrong.... but don\\'t think about it for now.Now it should be pointed out that you can solo this game, but the AI is pretty bad in loud missions and the game really rewards playing with friends especially on the higher difficulty levels. But probably the best thing about this game is the community and the development team for the game. There are constant updates and new heists, new weapons, new skills and even new faces. Some of these will cost you, and some are free, but in the end for the sheer amount of time I have spent in this game, and the fun I have had, this game and all its DLC have been superb value for money.\" - Gopher (YouTuber/LiveStreamer)Sums it up well :)',\n",

If you\\'re a fan of either of these titles, then this should definitely be on your list.Unlike Terraria or Minecraft however, it feels more like a game that has a plot and creates a desire to continue and develop that is otherwise absent in the previously mentioned titles. Minecraft (Vanilla) for instance, has it\\'s good points (it\\'s huge Modification base being a big plus), but it\\'s lack of tutorial and strong desire to complete the game lead many players into the deadly cycle of explore, build impenetrable fortress, get bored, explore...Starbound is not without flaw however. It\\'s still very much in development, so ignoring bugs and graphics issues, there is a huge level of potential for this title. With an engaging and well thought out game base, you are able to explore and progress smoothly. Simple old styled graphics, with coding for a more recent era of Sandbox styled games. For now, the bugs and glitches make it difficult to truly appreciate this game, but, once many coding has been sorted out and finalized ... Starbound looks to be a very impressive experience.PROS: Easy to learn. Huge degree of customization. Character creation. Fantastic soundtrack. Randomly generated landscapes and Mobs. Expansive environment (both is space and on-planet) Co-operative and PVP Multiplayer. Upgradeable Character CONS: Frame rate issues, highly buggy on some PC\\'s, and programming conflicts (Development). Certain areas are too easy, some are too hard (Balance).

(More in-depth review through the whole post)pros:+Story - great story, great ending.+Gameplay - even tho it gets sturdy, and there aren\\'t many combos you can do, it\\'s still when time comes a fun aspect of the game+graphics cons:-voiceacting - was pretty bad, mediocre at best if you want it-explosion effects-camera - sometimes, it can really annoy you how when you\\'re fighting a boss, it focuses and switches you from one place to the otherIt starts of really fast, and you kinda bump into a story. There\\'s no background, there\\'s nothing until you progress a bit through the game. Even then, you will ask yourself few questions, like, how did I get here where I am, what actually happend, but, even those \"loop-holes\" that exist in the story are minority, and should be ignored. The game picks it up once you go past the first chapter, the combat evolves, and you feel more connection to the characters. For me personaly, the way it was produced, I didn\\'t feel special bond between main character, nor the girl that was with you all the time. Story is something definitely memorable, and if nothing, you should check the game only for that. Gameplay and graphics are something that are also mediocre I would say. Levels are linear, so there\\'s nothing really to add up to it. Gameplay gets robust after a while, but what\\'s interesting in this game is that there isn\\'t that much of a combat as I thought it would be. There are few puzzles here and there, but that\\'s pretty much it. Graphics are also for a game that came out in 2013 I would say pretty solid. Nothing spectacular, effects when popping up the mechs aren\\'t fabulous, but that doesn\\'t stop this game to excell at what it\\'s best.',\n",

Let\\'s just say that I no longer find any enjoyment out of this. This is a game with tutorials that are about as easy to understand and Astro Physics, the difficulty curve makes it really hard for newcomers and really annoying for anyone else. In this game you build a town, get people to move in, manage the food, water, ect. Eventually you may even get a warrior to move in. The problem is keeping your people alive, with the management system not quite working, which is a big problem in a game that is all about managing. Here is an example...You set some of you villagers to start picking apples, drop them off, and then cook them into pies. You then get the rest of your crew to go mining, with the help of some warriors. After about 20 seconds the warriors decide to wander off, 2 of the 5 you had get themselves killed, on the way to the apple and pear trees your villagers manage to drown themselves, the rest come up from mining to find no food and then die from starvation on the way to pick apples.The result is a game that doesn\\'t want you to enjoy it too much.

       " '\"We have always appreciated the creative efforts of the PC modding community and we still fondly remember the awesome zombie invasion mod and original GTA map mod for GTAIV PC among many other classics. To be clear, the modding policy in our license has not changed and is the same as for GTAIV. Recent updates to GTAV PC had an unintended effect of making unplayable certain single player modifications. This was not intentional, no one has been banned for using single player modifications, and you should not worry about being banned or being relegated to the cheater pool just for using single player PC mods. Our primary focus is on protecting GTA Online against modifications that could give players an unfair advantage, disrupt gameplay, or cause griefing. It also bears mentioning that because game mods are by definition unauthorized, they may be broken by technical updates, cause instability, or affect your game in other unforeseen ways.\"It seems Rockstar didn\\'t intend for the latest update to disable Script Hook V, so modding can continue along as normal. Just make sure to not use any mods when playing online, because that\\'s just not fair to others who aren\\'t using mods. And to the whiny kids who keep crying about Rockstar banning them for mods, your \"mods\" are practically tampering the system, here is another articleThe most convincing/prevalent explanation I‚Äôve come across goes like this: due to the closed off nature of GTA V‚Äôs internal architecture, the so-called ‚Äúmods‚Äù that have made waves recently aren‚Äôt really mods in the traditional sense. They don‚Äôt add anything new. Rather, they tamper with pre-existing elements of the game‚Äîadd or subtract values, put whales where they‚Äôre not supposed to be, etc.‚ÄúTo give you an example of the dangers of allowing DLL Injected clients to connect to multiplayer servers or any other client for that matter, until recently, in Reign of Kings, hackers using the same method that scripthook uses, were using injected assembly code into DLLs to modify files on the computers of other players on the servers they connected to and in many cases, even the files on the servers themselves.‚Äù‚ÄúWhen we‚Äôre talking about DLL Injection, there is no such thing as singleplayer mod or multiplayer mod. It‚Äôs just foreign code being run, anywhere the user wants. The only way to prevent it is to check the integrity of the DLLs of any client on connection and cutting the connection as soon as a disprecency is found. It may seem like overkill, but the alternative is a complete loss of security for anyone using gta online.‚Äùfor short, the negative reviews are probably whiny kids who doesnt know whats going on and probably fell face first during birth, Rockstar have always been a great company supporting fans and players, if Rockstar didnt ban people the game would be swarming with cheaters. All these years Rockstar have been working hard to please their fans and this is how the gaming community repays them? Just because of one mistake? you kids have a rotten brain.P.S if you are one of those people who read the whole review, you should understand the current situation on why Rockstar are banning people is NOT because of the mods, its because the so called \"mods\" arent mods at all, it tampers the system in single player and multiplayer and may allow them to modify other players stats, we dont want that to happen right? Rockstar is simpy being extra cautious against players like these, so please do understand what Rockstar is doing.P.P.S if you got offended after being called a whiny kid, then you are a whiny kid.',\n",

       " '\\'Five Nights at Freddy\\'s is a fantastic strategy survival horror game that is probably the most scary and most intense game I have ever played. This game will make you sweat, shiver and scream.The idea of this game is you have been hired as a security guard at Freddy\\'s Pizza place. Your goal is to check all the security cameras, the lights, the doors, your environment, EVERYTHING to keep an eye on Freddy and the other the animatronic droids to make sure they don\\'t get to you. Otherwise they will see you as another droid without a Freddy costume and will try to stuff you inside of one (which will kill you). The objective of this game is to survive the night from 12:00AM to 6:00AM (each hour is around 1.5 minutes in length). You must survive all 5 nights to beat the game (The game saves at the start of each night). There is also an extra night and a custom night where you can choose the difficulty of each droid, on a scale of 1-20.The warning for this game is \"This game contains a lot of Flashing Lights, Loud Noises and Jumpscares\" If you really cannot cope with loud noises make sure to turn your game volume down to your satisfaction. The jumpscares in this game happen when the droids get to you. They jump right into your vision and perform a very loud robotic-like scream.This game I\\'d say has a horror scale of 8/10. I\\'ve always been a fan of Indie horror but this game is a masterpiece. It is scary and intense as F*CK!!! There is a free demo for this game online which only unlocks the first night. You can buy the full version for only $4:99 which is a pretty decent price for this kind of game. It\\'s worht the money.Overall this game is a very unique and fun idea for a horror game. I rate it 9/10, it is that good. If you are a fan of horror or Indie horror then I Highly recommend buying this game. Special thanks to IndieDB and the youtubers: Markiplier and Yamimash for introducing me to this game.',\n",

I suggest you go on the store and download this free to play, non catch game now!'I made this review aboout 11 months ago when I had only about 7 hours of experience, so I think I should update that now I'm almost at the 1000 milestone. This first-person-shooter looks like (from what I could tell) recieved quite a bit of hype with all the trailers and pictures uploaded onto the internet before release, which doesn't really change how the game will turn out but hype is generally a good thing. Before I got this game however, two years ago, my friend Qwertycoxy introduced it to me, and my thoughts were generally positive, but I really wasn't sure what I was doing exactly or the character's different attributes so I left thinking 'That was alright, but I would want more practice on it before I make a judgement' When I downloaded this game back in Feb 2013, I had little experience with the FPS genre so going into this was like trying something new while knowing the basics of it before hand. As months went on, I really got into things and I really started to enjoy the game as a whole. I began to learn the pricing systems which would later help me out quite a bit and my friend Ham introduced me to all these different fan-made game modes and even little minigames in those game-modes. Eventually I managed to unbox an Unusual which is without a doubt my highlight of the game so far. Anyway, the simpleness in the characters' abilities and the like really can be welcoming to new players and the like. I absolutely love the soundtrack to this game even though most tracks are only really featured in Valve-made Source Film Maker videos. I also adore the humour in item descriptions (official ones not so much the ones with a description tag used on) and the items themselves! These items really have their charm and I have to congratulate the community items that have made it into the game. I believe that this is a FANTASTIC game in every way possible (except the sparys but thats not just a TF2 problem) and I hope to still get hours of enjoyment out of it with all my friends!\",\n",

       " '(Anyone not interested in backstory, skip to next paragraph) Well... I have a lot to say about this game. Two years ago, as a person who was sick of all the physics builders where you build something extremely fragile and watch it crash into a wall and explode, I was looking for something new and different. One day, I turned Steam on, and in the daily feed that always pops up, I saw a new game had just been released on Steam called Robocraft. Immediately interested, I downloaded the game and found myself in literally exactly what I had been looking for ever since I first discovered Minecraft, a battle arena game where you build your contestants literally from scratch. The devs actively published new updates that improved the game, and for a good year, Robocraft was the best - and only - game I ever routinely played. A lot has changed since then.-The devs released this game with the intentions of keeping it as not only a free-to-play (F2P) game, but a free to win game as well, one where nothing that actually altered the gameplay would be locked behind paywalls. This is one of the issues I would like to talk about. The old system had you earning a certain amount of RP, the currency previously used, that you could spend on pretty much anything except for cosmetic parts, which didn\\'t affect gameplay at all. You earned a decent amount from playing, and each day, all of your bots in each garage (before, you started with 3 garages and had to pay for more) would have a 2x multiplier on your score from your first victory each day with each bot. This system allowed you to get what you wanted when you wanted it. Now, with the crate drop system, your hard earned winnings are completely randomized. One day you could get essentially nothing, the next you could get the rarest items in crate after crate. This system has more or less been fine with the endgame players and beginners, but the \"middle class\" of players - those who had been playing for a little while and were working their way up - got hit hard. You need a tank track to finally complete that bot, but don\\'t have enough Robits to forge one? Too bad, you got a hover blade or some cubes. That\\'s not even mentioning the horrible, and broken, economy (check the subreddit, one of my friends posted an explanation on how the system is broken).-The roboshop has also ruined the game. Once, if you wanted a great bot, you had to make it yourself or at least build it from the ground up with a guide, both of which taught you a lot on how to build a robot. But now, you can buy an overpowered bot from the shop without lifting a finger. This massively destroys the whole feel of the game, as you aren\\'t forced to learn how to make a bot better, cause if it isn\\'t, you can just dismantle it and buy a new one.-Finally, the devs aren\\'t listening to their community. They claim that the game is forged from the community\\'s feedback, but if it was, Epic Loot wouldn\\'t exist, or at least would be made with a much better economy. If you don\\'t get what you want from a crate, you can simply reforge it! ...or so was the idea. Let\\'s use a legendary as example. To buy a Mega SMG, it costs 125,000 Robits. To sell one, on the other hand, you would only get 31,250. Meaning it would take you 4 mega SMG\\'s, among the hardest items to randomly get in the game, to make 1. What kind of economy is that?!-TL;DR: Robocraft used to be good. The tiers more or less worked, at least better than it does now, we didn\\'t have or even want some of the items we do now, and the economy is not only bad, but also broken. The devs need to start listening to their community and bending the game to how the players want to play. My advice? Wait. Don\\'t get the game as it is now, and see if the devs finally change it to be fun as it used to be.',\n",

Hardly any lag or bugs so far, simply because I don\\'t play on public servers, so I can\\'t say anything about that. But going Han Solo gives you a great experience without aggressive players. The beginning is the most challenging part, because you start out naked somehwere on an island called \"PEI\", with nothing but a flashlight and maybe a candy bar and a juice box. Or, if you dislike getting killed by zombies, there\\'s the map \"Arena\" which has a slight Hunger Games feel.Pros:-It\\'s free-Little bugs or lag-Low(ish) learning curve-Variety of locations-Realistic-ish needs such as Thirst, Hunger, Sickness, and Stamina-Energy Drinks-Simple graphics-Skill cusomization-Did I mention it was free?Cons:-Heard of hackers on public servers-Heard of very aggressive players on public servers-Very easy after getting settled in with good items-Need to use the wiki for crafting-Only two, medium-sized mapsEnd Result:Get it, definitely! It\\'s free, so you won\\'t feel guilty about spending money if you dislike the game. Also, by the end of January there is a scheduled 3.0 update, that will hopefully fix most bugs and glitches, add a new \"Canada\" map, the largest map in the game, update the crafting, update the vehicles, and even add a new neccesity related to how cold you are. You can check the map update news yourself for some hype-inducing preview pictures!P.S.It\\'s free~REVIEW UPDATE~The 3.0 update came out, and Unturned\\'s new Beta mode looks great! Nelson is making great progress on upping the ante. Unturned is really beginning to shape into a full game, very akin to Day Z with the backpack system. The game mechanics are different from the Alpha, including a ton of different skills. There is fishing now, in case hunting wasn\\'t your thing, or you want to collect food without attracting too much attention but are too lazy to farm and settle. There is now a little bit of lore to how the apocalypse started, and the Canada map has been changed to PEI again. I have a feeling there will be exploration off of the island of PEI, but I haven\\'t exactly gotten that far yet. (Still free, btw.) The crafting system has been greatly improved, where depending on you crafting level in the skill tree, having an item will automatically show you what you can craft with it, along with the other items also required. Unturned Beta shows even more promise than the Alpha did. Oh, and watch out for Mega Zombies.

       " \"(TL;DR at the bottom)The mechanics were bad but the gimmick and story were good.First, the crap parts:It's a Flash game:The game went into low-quality mode during boss battles.You think my computer needs it?The weapons:The beam cannon you use to travel can be pretty terrible at times. Actually, everything but the shotgun is. For every single weapon, excluding the shotgun, there was a time I was yelling at the game. Really, many of the puzzles aren't fair due to how the weapons work. It could easily be fixed by say, removing a set of spikes or telling us the slingshot isn't like the shotgun.The glitches: Bosses would freeze or you could fall off the map of another after a respawn.The death mechanics:Spikes: Respawn on the last horizontal surface you touched.Pits: Respawn on the last horizontal surface.Fire: Restart map.Fall off the map: Whatever it feels like. To make a good game, you have one mechanic. Not two. This game learned from Meat Boy that games with a high potential of death need to have a quick and easy respawn as the respawn wait time doesn't enrage players. This also rewards players for doing one difficult jump. Something like Meat Boy would make you do it all again. However, you get to the hard bosses and you find you've been spoon-fed. From the mole onwards, fire is introduced. Or at least map restarts. You find due to the terrible beam cannon that unless you jumped vertically, you were more likely to go straight into the fire. And with most of the late bosses, I had no idea what to do. The boss I hated most was the one of the candyland. It had two ramps leading down. Now that's all fine, but the stages never have invisible walls. Walk too far off the left or right and you fall to your death. For that level (which involved going up and down ramps at high speed), it was likely that using the beam cannon to get you up higher would roll you off the map, causing the map to restart. This enraged me as the battle went slowly to use the new mechanic it introduced.Other levels that were unforgiving, however, were always short. That's a plus for me.The good bits:The story is stupid. It had me laughing. The personality is great. The entire point of the game is great. It's fun. Basically, everything else I haven't whinged about. Well, either good or tolerable in perspective.TL;DRThe game is bugged.The game is unfair due to bugs and design.This game could be fixed with some changes to map design and death mechanics.The game handles like a flash game.The story is funny.The game is original.Both were enough for me to enjoy it.New mechanics were added and were enjoyable.Play the demo to see if you like it. http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/558562\",\n",
       " '(This is all based on my own OPINION)Dark Souls 3 is a Hard game, that breaks off then the easy RPG.It never tells you were to go, and it sure as hell doesn\\'t give you an easy time when you get to the place you need to be. When I first started playing, it took me around 3 Hours to actually defeat (STARTING BOSS SPOILERS AHEAD) Ludex Gundyr, and Vordt, then make it over to the next area, I think I made 3-4 different characters to defeat Ludex, because I needed those Firebombs to kill Ludex Gundyr, thankfully. My friend(s) started to help me through the game once I got near the First Lord of Cinder, I\\'ve completed the game over 7 times now, I\\'m always trying different builds and seeing if I enjoy it or not.Most of my play time now, instead of trying to complete the game again, is helping out other players, and PvPing. (And praising that I don\\'t get into a fight club) Some people you find are fun to play with. Constantly chucking down \"Hello\" Carvings, and doing Gestures, Whilst others don\\'t even Gesture before going into a Boss Fog, or slicing you to Death.A few times I\\'ve gotten a good laugh out of some people. I was once invaded someone, and they looked like a Phantom (Due to using a Ring) I waited a bit nearbye, and then walked over, he did a Gesture to look like he was Resting at the Bonfire, he Waved. I did \"My Thanks!\", I used the Bloodlust Katana to stab myself, and rest. Whilst doing that. I realised that the Bonfire wasn\\'t lit, so I wanted to be kind, and wait for the Host to come. He constantly pointed at the Unlit bonfire, and so did I. He brang out his Bloodlust Katana and started to stab himself to do Death. I clapped constantly, he kept going, and killed himself, a moment later. I see on my Screen \"Host of Embers Destroyed!\"(TL;DR/etc. Is)Pros-Semi-Long game-Different to other RPG\\'s-Tries very hard to keep secrets to other Areas-Hard game-Allows for all different kind of Playstyles.-Doesn\\'t matter what Class you select at the near-end game once you\\'ve found most things.-Community is (most of the time) fun/funny to play with.-The Community is happy to help each other out (most of the time)-Addicting if you like the game itself-etc.Cons-Some OP weapons-Some Bugs that can pretty much one Hit something that can be Reposited-(For some people) the game not telling them to go can lead to frustration-Starting players will try to kill everything in there path, leading to the annoyance of dying to things much more powerful then you-(For some people) It is easy to not do one thing right, and that will lead to your Death-etc.Thanks for reading my Review.

       " \"(Warning, this review contains spoilers of the game)Ok, this mod is brilliant. Whoever thought of this is genius. The game mechanics of Portal are changed, but nonetheless still have the same feel to it and, although confusing at first, you get used to them.The only things that really sucks about this game are three things.1. There's this part where you have to deactivate some machines and stuff, you have to go on an insane track of jumping and speeding and everything, except my instincts told me to go to this little square in the wall, but when it said to skip the section ahead, I didn't read it properly and jumped it to it, and the worst part is that it doesnt even skip it, it plays someone playing it which was REALLY lame. I was really disappointed and I didn't want to play through the whole chapter again for that one bit.2. Like Portal, almost no replay value.3. The ending of the game is just really bad. This new personality core called Nigel (who is likeable and funny) has been hinted as evil and wants to kill you towards the end of the game. But the ending is just a copy and paste of the original Portal. You're on a platform, descending into fire and, because your paint gun was deactivated, there was no way to avoid it. The game even points out the loophole of you not needing to die, and the last thing you hear is just Nigel describing the rising temperature and then the credits roll. This left a really bad taste in my mouth and it just felt the same but worse, because at least in Portal there's a lot more even after you think the inevitable. That really sucked and I didn't like the ending really. And there's not even really any end in sight of the game, it just sort of ends.But overall, this game is worth the money. It's got a community workshop, which is pretty cool granting lots of possibilites. If you're a fan of Portal 2 you'll like this game.Pros:-Great mechanics-Great gameplay-Good voice actingCons:-Ending isn't up to par with the rest of the game-No replay value really-No real easter eggs of sorts8/10\",\n",

       " \"(if you cant be bothered reading this then just scroll down for the rating and reasons on why it's good and bad)It's a really good game considering its price however it does take a week to get used to the controls and how some of the gamemodes work in it but they don't have a tutorial... It's annoying how you do need CS: Source to view a lot of maps and items that most servers use but you can get those textures for free off of websites which is legal (just in case you think it isn't) or you can do it through a tiny bit more legitament way by buying it with Garry's Mod or standalone but I highly recommend buying it in a bundle as it does lower the price by quite a bit. If you can't be bothered installing all the textures by downloading them online then buying it would be better for you as all you need to do is download CS: Source and just go back onto Garry's Mod but if your like me and your going to barely play CS: Source then just buy it on a sale or download the textures (to be honest I did both because I downloaded the textures but about a month later the game was about $2 so I bought it anyway).7/10 for...Negatives:- Making it incredibly dificult to download the textures.- Forcing you to have them in the first place- Making CS:source way too overpriced considering it's not even that good compared to CS: GO which is newer and cheaper- No tutorials- Overly complicated tools considering thier is no tutorialPositives:- Lowering the price to $1 on sales- Making the original price $10 (considering its a online only game)- In-built workshop compatibility- So many different gamemodes- Some gamemodes are mixed in with others on some servers to create the ultimate game (sort of like Sandbox where you can do what you want and build with PVP where you can still do what you want but no flying through walls, building bases, killing others and still building amazing contraptions).In summary Garry's Mod is a great casual game that you can play everyday if you want but it isnt hardcore so it's meant to be more of a entertaining, funny game which is a lot better to play with friends and if you don't have friends then use a mic while playing on servers as it will be just as much entertaining (you don't have to have a mic either you can also type in chat).\",\n",

The graphics in this game are unbelieveable with its texture and detail of just the ground its amazing.But after all the need of the Golden Eagle(In-Game Currency)is pretty much very high,im using the British planes who made it to the tier 4 who is always struggling with In-Game Credits. im ending up bankcrupt ,this is what i fear in high tier gaming the need of a higher currency of something premium just play without any loss.      The In-Game matchmaking is one the worst that i would review,The new tier system making a lot of pro players in tier 3 and the new players who just made it to the tier 3 are very unbalanced.Considering myself using Russian tier 3 planes i see this often sometimes i get too good because of the new players that i dont like it because its not challenging enough and a whole of pro players that pretty much dominates every one but some of those pro players are positive hacker because i once  saw a low tier plane(A6MN) just ripped a wing of a well armored bomber(B-25 Mitchell) in seconds of firing it.So the match making system one of worst in War Thunder    Overall:this game is perfect for the players bored with the ordinary First Person Shooter game,a high graphic picture,its more a pay to win game   ',\n",

I did everything i could find out there to make this game go, then after this i went and started to look for a classic game....15 minutes later, nothing, so i started again, another 15 minutes and still no games. i changed my region to the US, and again the same thing! i tried the UK region....nothing! i ended up looking on steam spy, and even though ther are around 87,000 steam users who own the game, only about 100 - 200 people playing this game at any time. i tried for over 1 hour and using every server to try and find a match and nothing, i could not get one match in just over 1 hour! then i found there is a server browser, after looking in the make a game section of the match making...could have made it a bit easier to find there guys. then i tried all the regions again and looked for games to join, and i found 1 game in europe with 1 player.

When I heard it was released I quickly ran to buy it. The first maybe 2 hours of the game were great. Discovering how things work, getting my ship flying etc etc. After that the game just became a bit blank. It's just repetitive. The good: - Mass open world to explore- Not hard to navigate -Simple HUD design- Pretty amazing looking space to planet textures- Random occuring events (i.e attacked by aliens for cargo) - Interesting Alien encounters (Even if tedious. For example when you find space equipment on the ground you always find a alien) - Decent space combat (I've attacked a few fleets of ships and been wrecked by them appearing out of warp suddenly) - Fun little features like feeding animals- Definetly a decent game if you like exploring planets and such. - Enjoying the upgrade system as of now (Fueling is tedious though, but still really easy to do)The bad: - Buggy as ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• (as of right now you can't alt tab without crashing- You can't manually save- Random texture bugs- FPS occasionally kills itself- Crashes- Aliens really don't do anything - Planets do get repetitive - Mining the same minerals over and over is painful - Like others have said, knowing where you are in the whole universe would be nice. Atleast giving you a idea- Poor optimization for lower end pc's - No Black holes or abnomalies - Controls at times can feel clunky / irresponsive - Not really any tutorialOverall I do like this game and I'll continue to play it until it gets completely tedious. In 4.5 hours I've discoverd about 6 or so planets and actually flow down and discovered alien relics and stuff. I have absolutely no idea what they mean but hopefully that will play out. Hopefully better optimization will come (even though I haven't really had an issue with it) If you enjoy space games and laser cutting minerals and exploring many many many worlds while shooting space ships I would reccommend this game for you. If you're not into that but are slightly falling for the hype give it a miss. Until they add something or it goes on sale its not worth it unless you really are intrigued by the idea.\",\n",

Some of the early levels during this game are \"retrieve this\" or \"save him\" etc. But the mid to late stages of this game make it well worth it. The combat is relatively annoying at first, especially when you face the *******. Spoilers. Sorry. <3. For strategies/tactics I\\'ve mainly relied on the Scout/Commando classes, due to their abilities being useful no matter where they are on the map. PROS:- Nicely Paced game that doesn\\'t stray too far from what we know and love about XCOM- Agent Carter\\'s Hat is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing amazing. If it gets knocked off, you can even hit \"e\\' on it to pick it back up. Amazing.- Fits in well with the Enemy Unknown Timeline IN CERTAIN PLACES. I\\'ll come back to this later.- Nice Combat Mechanics and the Alien AI really knows what their doing- Set in the 60\\'s, how many alien games are set during the Cold War/Vietnam War Era??- Squads can be trained up to reach high levels and you can collect alien equipment to arm them!- The Hat.CONS:- Storyline for me so far can be a bit clunky- Some fragments of the storyline dont fit with Enemy Unknown- Total Campaign is estimated at probably 10hrs of gameplay for a casual gamer, but this comes to personal preferance- Squad Commands are a bit hard to get used to- Can\\'t keep Agent Carters hat on for the whole game :(Storyline Issues: ***SLIGHT SPOLER WARNING***While I do recognize that the XCOM Saga hasn\\'t been known for its whole Lore shizzle whizzle, some things don\\'t add up. During the events of XCOM Enemy Unknown, it is stated by Dr Vahlen that they have never seen these aliens before. Hang on a sec, this is set in the 60\\'s while EU was in 2015? I realise that Firaxis/2k may not have anticipated that this game would overide their original script for EU. During Enemy Unknown, we must also research Plasma and Laser technology however, I can bring home weaponry that includes both laser and plasma based weaponry to conduct research. Overall, this game started out fairly well with me, but after a while it came out brilliantly. The story revolving around the main character is a bit clunky and doesnt make sense with EU and EW, however I\\'d reccomend this game to the Casual/Competitive/Diehard XCOM Gamer who wants a 3rd Person Tactical Game that has the backing of a major developer such as 2k.Overall Rating: 7/10Thank you for reading this if you stayed this far! I\\'ve been considering starting a curator page/YT Channel so let me know what you think!P.S: Muton Elites will literally destroy you unless you spam the living ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• out of it.',\n",

Using the \"Chose your own adventure\" format, this game allows you to make decisions effecting your survival and directing where the story goes.  While Glenn and Herschel appear early in the game, all other characters and plot twists are original.If you are looking to fight zombie and shoot things, this is not for you.

Sorry Photon Arena, but that's how it is. Here's why:Pros:- Interesting survivor mechanics- Solid design and most things have a logical flow to them- Diverse enough game modes (unlike most other games of this type)Cons:- No tutorial game mode (or tooltips in-game). Sorry community guide writers (you guys are awesome), but a game like this should have one by default- Help section doesn't actually help much; the descriptions are quite bare; and there's missing content- Building functionality essentials are 'missing'; by that I mean, they aren't in the help section- Neutral NPCs appear as enemies on the map- Very repetitive events- I can hear the zombies, but I can't see them...in the day time**If you're one of 'those' people (and I can understand why)**- Made in Unity 3D <--- Not a con in my books (even though I am a UE person)I'm not asking for someone to hold my hand here, but there is a difference between hand-holding, and giving players a handy-dandy, well-written reference.\",\n",
       " \"**This review is based on the base game**A great grand strategy game from Paradox.  The first in their 4 strategy series, this game is set in the medieval period, streching from Ireland to India and Iceland to Mali.  The base game ranges from 1066 (norman invasion) - 1453 (fall of constantinople).  In CKII you try to continue dynasty - trying to make it the most prestigous in Europe!  The game is centered around your dynasty and succession.  If your heir is not of your dynasty, it's game over.You start as a count/earl, duke, king or emporer controlling one of the counties, duchies, kingdoms or empires on the map.  Without any DLCs, you can only be a christian ruler and not a merchant rebublic.  You cannot be a theology (pope/bishop).  The game also features baronies, cities and bishoprics but that cannot be your primary title.  As a ruler you manage vassals (rulers below you) and try to please - or overthrow - your leige (ruler above you).  The feudal ranking is as below (above = liege; below = vassal): - Emporer - King - Duke - Baron/Bishop/MayorYou can be a liege to someone below you, but not equal or above you.  Your vassals are only below you - not equal to you.A Catholic (usually) follows the pope, and the pope can orders crusades.  The crusades can be based on real historical crusades (such as many of the ones for Jerusalem) and crusades to rid infidels/heritics.  Any catholic ruler can join a crusade, and the winner of the crusade is defined by how much they contributed to the crusade.  Winning the crusade will sometimes grant the winner all titles (including baronies).Each character has traits.  Your traits affect peoples opinion of you and your diplomacy, martial, stewardship, intriuge and learning level.  Traits will be passed on by the guardian of a child and by events occuring to an adult (16+).  Few traits will be passed on through birth (such as genius) but there is only a small chance.One of the games biggest features is Casus Beli (CB).  A CB is a justificaiton for war - something you need to attack a ruler of your own faith. CBs can range from De Jure claims to Overthrow ruler.  A claim is just that - you or one of your courtiers is related to the ruler of the title you want.  Whether that relation is a blood relation, or through marriage it doesn't matter.  The independence or overthrow ruler CBs are against you liege, and are self explanetory.  Holy wars can be declared on heretics/infidels.  Another type of claim is the de jure claim.De jure is where is the title is traditionally in that duchy/kingdom/empire.  For example, the duchy of cornwall is de jure Wales, but is owned by England.  It takes 100 years for de jure to change, and it will only change if you have the whole duchy.CKII is an excellent strategy game - if you have the patience.  It can be quite frustrating at times, and will boggle your mind with all the confusing succession laws.  This game is a great mix of plotting, pleasing and prisoning, not to mention declaring all of that war.  With over $100 worth of DLC, there is a huge base for expansion and the game also has a big modding community.9/10\",\n",

It has all you need to get started - the default build even comes with a main AND pause menu!So, let's play pros and cons:Pros:- Simple to navigate UI- A LOT of pre made stuff to make prototyping quickly- Documentation for the programmers- Reasonable price (when I bought it)- People make stuff for this game in Workshop- Some cool stuff in the workshopCons:- It's easy to tell when someone has made a game with this program- Most of the community made graphics conform to the grid of RPG Maker - making most of the stuff look 'generic'- Want to make a turn-based strategy? Best you find something else.- learnerFirendly = preMadeCode ? No : Yes (programmers will understand this); - Documentation isn't as in-depth as some of the meatier engines out there- People make stuff for this game in Workshop- Pre-made events make it easier, but what if you wanted to make a game in a different engine?TL;DRGood for top-down RPGs, not so much for other games - but not impossible\",\n",

       " \"*NOTE: THIS IS AN OLD REVIEW. Tiers aren't a thing anymore, but for all effective purposes, the game still handles well in that regard*I totally reccommend this game to anyone and everyone.Generic statement aside, the concept of building and fighting your own personalised robots is not only an amazing idea, but Freejam executed it in a very nice way. You build with the base armor blocks a frame for your robot, and then deck it out with weapons, movement, electroplate (shields) and various other tech. The variety of different things you can build is endless, even now with the game still in development, and there exists a Tier system that sorts robots based on their 'rank' (higher level blocks add more rank) so that, as a newbie you're not getting thrashed by the elites running around with Tier 10 death machines.To me, the only downside is that Robocraft is a little pay-to-win. You can buy GC with real money, which you can use to buy parts at huge discounts, or to get premium, which boosts the amount of Tech Points and Robo Points you earn from battles. It's really, really enticing. Trust me, I have a bunch of Premium. However, this problem gets solved pretty nicely by the Tier system. All you do with premium is advance Tiers more quickly; the way the game is designed prevents premiums from being able to completely destroy non-premiums. So, aside from a little jealousy from the guys you leave behind in the lower Tiers, it really doesn't affect gameplay in any way.ADDITION - 29/10/2015So the first parts of my review are a year old now. Robocraft has seen a LOT of internal changes in that time. That sums up what Robocraft was and still is - an early access game. As a result, I've gone between playing and not playing over the course of the past year, as new changes turn me away from the game but I inevitably come back and learn to love them. Every new update, there are hordes of angry players - 'RIP Robocraft, wtf you doing Freejam I'm never playing this again'. And if you play too, you'll likely feel this way for a few days, but then after that it doesn't really matter. The game is still fun at its core and that's what matters.Overall, I give Robocraft a 9/10\",\n",

They are great, fun, and silly... though there\\'s a few drawbacks out there.Most of these Arena party games are platformers... and too many people have WAAAY different skill levels in platformers to make them fun or fair.This game is a lot more like starwhal \"new\" control scheme, a game where most people are unfamiliar with the controls, starting everyone off on a level playing field. What this game has going for it is a really strong sense of \"Honourable combat\", \"Casual rulemaking\" and \"Improvisation mid combat\"\"Looking at each other across the arena, blood has been spilled, but both your weapons are aflame... the rain starts... everything else seems to fade into the background, Slowly spinning up the hammer, charging forwards, both you and them start screaming...\"Moments like that seem to flow and occur naturally, Blows and weapon exchanges seem just right, your opponents rarely outskill you to the point of futility, and when amazing dagger throws do happen, there\\'s nothing but awe across the couch. It feels like one of the few local multiplayer games where battlecries feel appropriate and easy to do. The game is really good at encouraging \"epic memorable moments\", everything feels fair (even when it\\'s unfair).The game is also nice in offering casual rulemaking. You have an immediately apparent unspoken social contract for politeness, a weapon selection as required, not needing to go into a \"Mutators screen\" to disallow certain items... as most friends are amiable to not allow swords, or to only go for punches, or overhead attacks... it\\'s just really nice and refreshing not having to go back out to a menu to get that stuff done.It\\'s also really nice to see a bit of panic mode support, where your thrown weapon misses the target, and now you\\'re running away from a psycho with a flaming spear, grabbing and tossing everything in your path to try escape... until either you manage to pick up another dagger and fling it at him... hopefully with a little more luck this time... or you run into a wall and get skewered...Really, this is just an essential party game that doesn\\'t lose it\\'s lustre quickly, Get it if you\\'re sick of platformers as your only party game options for sure. Get it if you\\'re the type that can convince their friends to bring two controllers over.Remember that you hold X while picking up to dual wield!',\n",

       " \"*SLIGHTLY SPOILER-Y*As silly as it sounds, my experience playing Undertale was just that: an experience. Gameplay-wise, it's incredibly simple. Walk, talk, battle enemies. But it's how it utilizes those simple elements and creates a powerful story centered around it. As you walk from point A to point B, you can feel that you have made a journey. You're exploring this foreign, perilous world, you grow attached to the interesting and quirky characters you meet, and the way you face against your enemies is actively shaping the outcome of your adventure. This is a game were, like in real life, everything has powerful consequences that you can't just run away from (even if you try the age old habit of save scumming, something that Undertale LOVES to pull apart and analyze).A lot can be taken from Undertale, and very rarely does a game succeed in so many ways on leaving a mark on its player. Many of the game's concepts (the deconstruction of the rpg, the psychology of in-game characters and the godlike powers of a player to manipulate the game's world) can of course be preached by lesser artist's, but TobyFox has combined visuals, gameplay, story, music, and character and shaped them all into such a unique game that has proven it deserves all the recognition it gets.While I may not have the heart to play the game again, I absolutely want to see other players experience it for the first time like I did.

       " \"*Take this review with a grain of salt*Before I go through this review, please note that this game is not for everyone. Alright, let's begin.StoryThe story was somewhat predictable, yet still good. It revolves around the main protagonist (Neptune), who has lost her memory and slowly brings the main cast together who at first hate each other, but later on become friends. They then band together to fight an evil person thretening to destroy the world. Relatively cliche.One thing you'll pick up straightaway is the reference to other games and anime. Oh god the references. Also there's fanservice. GameplayThe gameplay, in my opinion was solid. You don't need to excessively grind, so long as you know what you're doing and not avoid every monster. Strategic placement of your characters is a necessity for victory in the later stages. Great thing is, exp is shared with your entire party. For example, if you gain 5000 exp from a battle, EVERYONE gets 5000 exp, unlike some games which only give the most based on who does what. This significantly speeds up the levelling process. There is also the remake system which I'll go into further detail after.Remake systemAlright, so basically when this game got remade from the original, they changed the storyline up a little and added this new feature called the REMAKE SYSTEM. Basicaly, what it allows you to do is add new dungeons, enemies for those dungeons, you can change the item pick ups, make new accessories and just create a load of stuff. Great addition to add variety to the game.New Game+One important feature of this game is NEW GAME+. Once you've finished the game, you can redo the game again and go for a second cycle. This is necessary to get all the added CPU candidates which you can create via the remake system. The good thing is, all your credits, experience, levels and items get rolled over, so you cna go for the achievements that you may have missed in the first run. The bad thing is that enemies dont get stronger at all, so if you're a high enough level, you have no challenge at all (aside from the colosseum).DLCPlease note that DLC is not necessary to get all achievements, so its not a forced buy.The DLC allows you to unlock 3 new characters:-Histiore-Peachy-PlutiaAnd the additional packs give you 300 levels per pack and added dungeons and colosseum battles, so you can go back and have more fun.All in all, you get 3 characters, 900 additional levels and new dungeons if you decide to purchase every DLC.So to sum upIf you're an anime fan, like loli protagonists and have some money to throw at a screen, this is the game for you. As far as I'm concerned, it's worth the money and time that I invested in it and I don't regret one bit of it.Pros:+Remake system+No endless grinding+Lots of characters+Good variety+Good gameplay+Fanservice+Nice variety of personalities+Good parodies+Great soundtrackCons:-Story lacks twists and can be cliche at times-Character voices can sometimes be irritating to listen to-Hard boss fights if you dont grind levels at early stages-Difficulty curve on some parts are too extreme9.5/10Once again, it is not for everyone, but I highly recommend this game. Also, this is much better than the original so don't bother trying the original and go straight for the remake.\",\n",
       " '*This Game Is Extremley Good!*I mean for being free this game takes it to the next level, the one thing i complain about is when people say things like \"MINECRAFT + TERRARIA = OUR GAME!\" Stop having to leech of the name Minecraft to attract 8 year olds, the game is good enough to pull in players anyways. Also this game is N o t h i n g like minecraft so a waste of advertising. I really enjoy this game except i cannot get to tier 3 even though I purchased all tier 2 upgrades and have like 10 T3 Guns. I\\'ll keep playing and hope to see it blossom even more!',\n",

       " \"*This is more of a first impressions review, I have not gotten very far and may or may not edit this review later*Saying Pixal Piracy is Terraria but with pirates is nowhere near giving this enough credit. This game clearly has complexity far beyond Terraria.No, a better way to describe it is... an adventure micro-manage-it-up. With the many abilities, crew, weapons and ship parts, this has potential stuck up the wah-freakin'-zoo not to mention that daunting hunger system, that some players may find a tad too hard, and the cleaning and repairing and the fishing and the...Ok, I'll stop.Basically, this is a complex game, from what I've seen so far. If you aren't ready to micro-manage the hell out of stuff, you may find yourself being confused and getting yourself into an infinite loop of starving to death. (Like me)Overall, Pixal Piracy has a lot of potential and if you're fine with buying games that are still in development, and are all good with micro-managing, I highly recommend this as it is a super fun game.\",\n",

       " \"+: Combines aspects from other games in a way that makes the game truly unique in its own way.+: One of the only if any MMO's that allows you to dig on the terrarian itself (although you can't build on the terrain unless it's in your own 'cornerstone' which is basically your own portable headquarters that you craft things at).+: For an MMO this game took an interesting style of graphics that I haven't seen done before (in an MMO).+: A bunch of classes to chose from, all seeming quite different from one another.+: The game is free.+: Can be a good MMO for someone who's never played one.+: You can 'deassemble' a weapon or accessory you don't want to turn it into crafting materials that you may find more useful.(Stating this) Many reviews on here say that the problem with the game is that it takes so long to connect to servers but this has been fixed (to my understanding).-: Although there is a huge arsenal of weapons (that you are pre-assigned based on your class e.g. Shadow Archers will ONLY receive bows) none of them actually change the way you fight or for that matter give you any feeling of variety.-: You progress so quickly that an item you picked up that you may have considered to be really good at the time can quickly become outdated in terms of stats. The game tries to make you feel good with this system of constant rewards and progression although it fails because you don't actually feel accomplished.-: No storyline, NONE.-: This game is repetitive, most of your objectives in this game are basically 'kill this and receive this' or... 'mine this and receive this'.  Due to there being no storyline you find yourself asking 'why am I even doing this?!'.-: No actual quests, you have a pre-determined set of quests that every player in the entire game is also doing. You have no freedom to do what you want (that is if you want to actually make progress within the game), you MUST complete the assigned quest to move onto the next one.-: The  entire game  is randomly generated making there feel like there's nothing to actually explore, it's just randomly generated terrain and dungeons (that also seem to be very repetitive). -: You must make an account for the game itself, this isn't so bad on its own however it can be very frustrating trying to get your verification code from your email to work (both me and my friend had the problem).-: Character customization itself is bad, (not the hats, there's plenty of those). there aren't many color options, as far as physical traits just about all you can do is change your skin color (e.g. you cannot change your height, width, etc.).-: Things in the tutorial seem to be out of order, for example around my first hour of gameplay I was being being told the buttons used to attack even though I had already killed loads of enemies.-: Does not have very much music.-: All drops are marked as uncommon/rare+ when it comes to the rarity tag of an item, I've never seen a single item marked as 'common'. I feel the game does this to make you feel more accomplished.This game has/had a lot of potential, it really did. Sadly I have to say that I must give this game a 4/10 for the reasons listed above.\",\n",

I know a lot of work has gone into this game, and a lot more hours will be spent making it the greatest it can be.Pro\\'s- Closest thing to Harvest Moon itself.- Love the details/graphics- Calming Tunes ( May get annoying after awhile )- Easy to waste a year of your life away- Early Access, ( room for improvement )- Somewhat playable- Playable via Steam- Fast and easy start up- many, many more, and I\\'m sure i\\'ll have more to add when I\\'ve played more hours.Cons; Annoying Features/bugs/Glitches I noticed.

       " \"- RECENT REVIEW -New engine, completely rebuilt, lots of updates, It's a pretty decent game again, although, having a beast computer is the only way to see the new engine at its best, It's too overwhelming on my computer, and i'm having trouble playing it with all my settings either off or extremely low.Its got lots of new additions, such as a completely new map, which is absolutely massive, and if you die without a sleeping bag placed, chances are you aren't going to find your spot again anytime soon if ever, horses, they're quite cool, and the deer, the animals are just completely awesome, except for the wolves, they could be downgraded, they run way too fast and glitch all over the place.all different types of building, wood, stone, sheet metal, reinforced, locks, cupboards, There's so many new features and additions, it's all had a makeover and is pretty.. hahaI guess it's a decent game again, depending on the server you play on, I won't be playing it as much as i used to, but it's a nice treat every now and then :)- EARLY ACCESS REVIEW -I stopped playing a fair bit after zombies were removed and replaced with mutant bears and wolves, It just wasn't as much fun, I enjoyed finding an amazing server with a decent community, running around the map on resource runs and seeing who could headshot a zombie first, Zombies really were the highlight of this game for me, after that was removed, everything went bad, there were no decent servers, there were hackers, less updates, found myself and a friend just throwing flares down a hill and watching it roll, for about 3 hours, and that was all we did. Thus, Rust had nothing more to offer for me and I completely stopped playing it.- EARLY EARLY ACCESS REVIEW -Rust well.. It's different.It may be in Alpha but it's already such a great game, I'm excited and dreading new updates, I love the way it is at the moment, not knowing if the upcoming developments will ruin what i think or make it even better, going to have to wait and find out, I spend most of my time playing this game, Surely enough playing on a populated server isn't a good idea, it'll ruin your experience all together, the key is to find a decent server with only about 20-40 people online, i'd say start off with a pve until you get the hang of things. Also playing on Official servers aren't exactly the best idea.Wolves and bears have a fair amount of health compared to the zombies, bears and wolves you have to avoid until you have a bow or a gun, zombies you can take on with a pickaxe etc. This is a great game and definitely worth the money, considering it's in Alpha, it's damn well good.I thought it'd be one of those games that look great but turn out pretty bad, Looks great, is great.The only downer for me is the fact it over heats my laptop, and that's when I play with Render Quality 0, and run it on the fastest option. The graphics are great.. but I can't really play with them. I have a decent gaming laptop.. but still It overheats so I have to take breaks and I don't like that.All in all, Great game, definitely worth a look at :)I'm sure more people would buy it if there was a demo, then again it's in alpha and only $20, Still worth a look :)I surely don't regret this game and I won't anytime soon =D\",\n",

The things thats different about ROTMG is that when you die you die for good (and you lose all your items).  This concept makes the game challenging and makes you try hard not to die. The loot system is also really good so you feel rewarded when you almost die getting an awesome new item.Even though you only get 1 character slot by default, the game is free and it is worth paying $20 to get the begginers pack.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\",\n",

Hopefully they patch it soon, because the game did just release and it seems like these wouldn\\'t be hard fixes.EDIT (3/29/16): The latest patch has fixed NUMEROUS issues, making the game feel completed now. I would most certainly reccomend this game right now, as most bugs and issues have been fixed. PC users can finally say we have an actual, good wrestling game now :D',\n",

       " '-=SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW=-If you have got patience, a passion for physics games and a great computer, then you should be able to enjoy this game.Octodad: Dadliest Catch wasn\\'t one of the usual games I play. At the start we open with controlling Octodad, as you will throughout the game. This was one of the easiest sections in the game. Finding bowties, opening doors, and throwing objects at glass panes. It was a great way to do a tutorial, but as you walked down the carpet towards your bride, it became difficult. \"Don\\'t let people notice you\\'re an Octopus.\" And by doing so, you had to avoid breaking things. And after each level there was the small chase with Octodad and The Chef. While running you\\'d have to continuously switch between leg and arm control as you moved objects out of your path. After mastering the switch the game starts to flow easier.Later on the game became progressively harder with it\\'s challenges, such as the obstacle course in the aquarium. Moving across unstable platforms with lag was quite a tricky challenge, so I had to experience the game with my graphics set low. Also some people might notice the game glitching now and then. Items would mysteriously tear apart when you tried to grab them, or they\\'d get stuck in walls. It\\'s a good little game, sad to see it finish so soon. The script was funny. I purposely took long periods of time to hear what some of the people had to say. . \"This is scarier than an ocean full of spiders. . And Tommy!\" \"Dad, if you left me here, fish would adopt me!\" I also really enjoyed the story line, which it\\'s always good to have a nice story line for your game. So when you look past the glitches, the challenges and the odd physics with the default settings, It\\'s actually a rather good game. Just I recommend the game for people who have good patience.',\n",

It's a definite win for avid zombie fans and is a reminiscence for the good old times. Dead Island has an array of features not only the brain dead zombies per se but also weapon crafting, somewhat open-world experience and at times, mowing down horde of zombies with a rusty car. It's a great game indeed and deserve the accolade as TMoZG. [As if that acronym exist] On the other hand, unlike the console platform, the PC platform does have it's flaws. In hindsight, the game does stutters due to poor optimization even with a GTX 760. But then again, that's about it. Oh, totally not for the weak-hearted. Compared to Dead Island Riptide, this stands out. Nothing beats the original that's for sure. Having said all of these, Dead Island does pumped me up for Dying light and Dead Island 2 as a starter kit.\",\n",

       " \"-Final ReviewHektor is a very disappointing experience for the USD$14.99 that it currently charges. It has a nonsensical story that is neither as sophisticated as it thinks it is, nor as interesting as it tries to be.  Its music and art assets are frequently recycled throughout the entire game. It currently has barely 2 hours of game content, which is encased in a platform that seeks to draw out the experience over 3-4 hours through the use of confusing level design.Then there's the glitches, like being unable to interact with in-game items that are necessary for you to proceed further, causing you to have to reload your game. The worst part, and perhaps the most insulting thing about Hektor, is that it isn't scary at all. Outlast was scary, Alien Isolation was a stressful and harrowing experience. Hektor? Hektor is a complete disgrace to the horror genre of games. Watch any of the lets-plays that are currently on Youtube. Not a single one of them is enthralling, immersive, or in the least bit frightening. Many claim that the game's atmosphere is intensely creepy, and that they would prefer a game like Hektor to one filled with jump scares. Sure, jump scares alone do not make a horror game. Neither do games that are all about the long drawn out creepy atmospheres that eventually amount to nothing. You can only play so much of Hektor before you feel cheated and violated, like the boy who is strung along by a candy man with all the promises of a sweet future, only to end up in the back of a windowless van. No, there is nothing causing that sound that appears to be made by the wheels of hospital beds rolling across the corridor. Its just one of the many sound assets that the game randomly plays every now and then to build up 'atmosphere'. In fact, I haven't seen a single hospital bed move in this game. How about those creaks and groans and that squeaky violin sound you hear as the background music reaches its crescendo? Yup, just more of the same. Sounds with no force of a credible threat behind them. And do you know why there is no hiding in this game? Because there is no need to - the game is a bloody walking simulator. The only threats in Hektor reside in the creatures that you will encounter in this game, and what a disappointment they are.The developers advertise this game as having a horrific monster that tirelessly pursues you. Yes there is only one monster in the game capable of killing you. But the only times you experience being chased by this presence is halfway through the game when you first come across it, and towards the end when the game artificially ramps up its difficulty level by putting the creature in your path. Beyond those two occasions, you almost never encounter the creature, much less get 'pursued' by it. Additionally, it is difficult to be afraid of a monster that has pathing issues. There was one occasion when the monster ran continuously into a box that was in front of me as it tried to get at me. Besides this monster, the game scatters, with no logical rhyme or reason, half naked deathly pale people around the map. These death-camp prisoner of war lookalikes cannot hurt you physically, but are capable of reducing your character's sanity level if you are near them when they scream. The first time you encounter one of these people is a decently shocking experience, but towards the later part of the game, their presence is at best an irritating encounter as the game uses the same audio asset for their screams, and at worst you might end up laughing in their face, especially when you see their ridiculous transition from person into a reddish spectre. Who are these people-like things? What is that monster that chases you? What is the Hektor program? Who are you? Why are you at the facility? How did you come to develop your psychosis? Why do you guzzle antipsychotic medications like M&Ms? You'd probably have a better chance of getting that information from God than this game. In fact, Hektor hardly explains anything properly. The game conveys its tale singularly through badly written journal or diary entries that are randomly distributed throughout the entire level in a humdrum and erratic manner.  Walk into the intelligence room for the first time, pick up a journal entry. Walk into the intelligence room again at a later time, great there are 2 more journal entries to pick up. What the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• is this? Shouldn't the intelligence room be empty now given that I have just explored it earlier? The entire attempt feels so lazy, so half-hearted. It destroys any remaining immersion that one might have in the game up to this point. The main story is simplistic. It is also full of boring cliches. How many times can we pretend to be interested in the stories told by the people who eventually develop the 'crazies', or some aggravated form of 'stockholm' syndrome? Leave that for the bad movies, it is their rightful domain. You are supposed to be making a horror game that scares us, unnerves us, that makes the hairs on our skin stand as we uncover the story bit by bit. And this is the best you can come up with? $14.99 is too much money to spend on this utter filth and garbage. $14.99 is too much money to spend to be insulted by the developers, who think they can masquerade this bad cashgrab as a 'psychological horror game'. The only thing that is horrifying about this game is our ridiculously low expectations when it comes to paying for and hyping garbage like this on Steam. If you enjoyed 'Daylight', which is another horror game with procedurally generated levels, you might enjoy Hektor. They are both equally bad. Another option is to skip both games, and simply watch a let's play from one of the better youtubers out there. It will require a considerable amount of good acting skills on the part of the youtuber to beat some life into this dead dog's body.Otherwise, FASTER FASTER... avoid Hektor. You have been warned.\",\n",

       " '0/10 - Because review scores are ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t.This game had potential but quickly turned into a Cash-grab for SMS and became a joke of an E Sports contender, with all of the community events in 2016 focusing soley on the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t E Sports market.Most cars and tracks are old models from other SMS games and the only insult to it is the price to pay for it.Some car classes are broken by the DLC cars, throwing old road cars in with old race cars or mixing F1 cars, the 72D will never keep up with the 78. AI selection is absent too, so doing a mixed field GT race will have ALL THE CARS with GT in their title in the field, ever wanted to race against a GT40 while doing the Bathurst 12 Hour in a GT4 Mustang while still having the GT3 cars to overtake you? TOO BAD!There also seems to be a load of bugs still, during online races I would often get wrecked just by tapping wheels, one time even being wrecked because the game glitched the grid, placing another car under me.The FFB took me a year to get to a level where I could enjoy driving it, being a confusing mess and I only sorted it when I stopped using FFB setups that would be considered \"Normal\" in my other wheel-based games.AI is great in this game, aside from a few bugs that have the AI pit on the last lap of a race if it starts raining (which ruined a perfect enduro race I staged) but aside from a few buggy classes of vehicles, most of the rest can kerb-hop and battle for position sometimes, if the game doesn\\'t go and supercharge them like it is prone to do.You can have some fun with this game, offline it is a decent simcade mode.As I have said before with other racing sims, wait until the second game and even then, give it a few months before buying this one to see if the 2nd game can be improved over this mess, which could have cornered the Gran Turismo for PC market that some of us have been waiting for since GT turned to crap.',\n",
       " \"0/10 - Because review scores are ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•tCodies latest rally sim is exactly that, a proper sim... for the most part.The cars are mostly from DiRT 3 with a few extra cars thrown in but they were chosen in DiRT 3 for a reason and they all seem in place here.I do club rallying myself and D.R is exactly that, it's basically racing old WRC cars in semi-pro events that somehow pay major dollars, you end up doing the same stages over and over again so I recommend playing this game about once every two weeks rather than just sitting down and playing the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• out of this game.The stages are really 6 locations with 2 massives stages cut up into pieces, now, in a club rally we do this all the time but even then in real life the stages are all 20km long. D.R feels like a rallysprint but this also allows a few more people to complete events. The monthly challenges can be up to 2 hours long - That's a regular rally on a Saturday night for most real drivers.The game itself is graphically lovely, the physics are insane and show just how good Codies can make games.But nothing can replicate the amazing terror of throwing yourself through a dark forrest on a logging trail that was only driven on the last time you had a rally there. (and I'd love for Codies to come to Australia and make you sim racers have a go at some of our stages)This was plainly thrown together to get a CMR style title back into the mainstream press and now that it's released the 2nd game will most definitely be a WRC game with a car and stage list to make you think back to the old CMR days, Having some old oddities of cars would make a nice addition to the seemingly standard car list that lands in every rally game.Beast of a game that punishes you for mistakes.\",\n",

Not to mention the constant regular updates and bug fixes, really it's just terrible that these people are actually DOING stuff to improve the game.

Come on Codemaster, just make all eras available at once, most people born in the 1980s wouldn't have much interest in those 1960 or 70s old school cars)3.

With immersive game play and endless character customisations Torchlight II is highly addictive.  As many other reviews have mentioned, if you are a lover of Diablo II then give this game a shot.My favourite feature in Torchlight is the unique pet system; you chose from a wide selection of strong companions with customisable gears and skills.  These companions are very functional and an important support tool.  They can be fed different food (that you fish yourself from ponds discovered throughout the game) which morph your pet into different creatures that provide various stat bonuses for a limited period of time.Well made, no problems at all with bugs etc.',\n",
